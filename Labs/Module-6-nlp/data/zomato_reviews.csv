The Tossed Panner was so healthy and seriously this health was worth the taste.",positive
Aerocity is the most finest place in Delhi for luxury dining as the place is too clean and it's a place with good view.

"Aerocity has my heart. I love everything about that place, Hence i keep looking out for good restaurants so that I can spend as much time as possible there.

This was my first time so I tried: AL the dishes were upto the mark. The cocktails were an interesting blend of exotic flavors. The ambience is every sports lover's dream. The outdoor seating is as chic as the indoor seating. As my very first experience was beyond amazing, I'm surely going to come back.",positive

So this was the most awaited place - Virat and Anushka's restaurant i.e. One 8. It is a spacious restaurant with good food and happy vibes. There's a tshirt of Virat Kohli also in which he officially signed it. Coming to food we ordered veg and non veg dimsums. Chicken dimsums were super yummy. Veg were okayish in taste. The shakes were very tasty. Burger chicken sliders were also good. Punjabi chole are worth trying. And lastly the dessert was just amazing!üòç,positive

We were served with around 7-8 starters including crispy chicken wings , chaat , paneer tikka , fish , gol gappe and mushroom. In drinks we had kala khatta , aam ala banta and some cocktails. Coming to main course we had dal makhani , chicken and paneer with some breads . Best part was deserts with huge variety. Overall had a great experience . Highly recommended.",positive
"Probably the best buffet in town, the moment you step in the outlet eye-catching ambience and positive vibes win you hearts. Very welcoming staff and quick service were just cherry on top. The food from starters to desserts was outstanding. Somewhat they can improve themselves in drinks section, otherwise one of the best grill experience I ever had. Biryani and tara ghosht were best.Desserts were amazing, just the kind of ending you want. Will surely visit this place again with my family",positive
"I visited this place with my family to celebrate my cousin's birthday. We had a great time. The place serves Indian buffet. We tried all the starters, mains and desserts. The chicken wings and mushroom tikka stood out in the starters. The dal makhani and murgh makhanwala stood out in the main course. The chena payas and shahi tukda stood out in the desserts.",positive
"Visited this place for Saturday lunch. The food was great, from starters to desserts all were yum . The only thing that I‚Äôm giving it 4 stars is because the service was slow for starters. We literally waited for 5-10 mins to get our desired starters.",positive
"My brother recommend The GT Road to me based on his past experiences as he is a regular at the same. My experience too was great. The ambience was very different as compared to it's competitions. As the name suggests, the design is inspired by old times where you can find utensils which our grandparents might have used. The food items are inspired from local cuisines of places which lie on the Grand Trunk Road, whether it is Howrah or Lahore or Kabul. As far as service is concerned, full marks to the staff and management. Thanks to Ashok Sawant and Sumit for taking care of my evening. üòá",positive
Best buffet in town . The taste is impeccable the variety is unbeatable. The quality and taste are extremely good. The sweet selection is huge and the see is quick Worth the money . Good for feasting and gorging,positive
"Went here on Sunday for lunch. The place was so crowded that it affected the service and ambience. It was so hot inside the restaurant may be due to live grill and over crowdedness. Service was not good. Have to ask manager twice or thrice in order to speed up the service as we were waiting for quite a long. Infact, all the snacks in the menu were not served until asked for. Coming to the food, it was nice. Desserts were the best part of the buffet. Had a pretty nice meal though. It‚Äôs a kids friendly place so that was another plus point. In drinks, we order kala khatta drink which was fine. Not great though. Best snack was pineapple grill which we had to ask them to serve and in desserts, sheer khurma and custard jelly was delicious. Food: 4/5 Quality: 4/5 Service: 3/5 Ambience: 3/5",positive
Good food. Great variety of snacks and main course. Very authentic flavours of dishes. Rich and flavourful food. Desserts too were very good and tasty. Overall experience was lavish- worth a try. Surely,positive

Perfect for couples to get lost there with Ur partner and the ambience ! Ordered Pan roasted prawns and Norcina! Prawns were very tasty though quantity was on lower side ( just 4).

I tried Goat Cheese Stuffed Spanish Green Pepper Fritters which was served with this sweet pickle and it tasted good.

"Visited on a weekday at 8pm, as expected there was a waiting of 90 minutes. We got a table for two tucked in a tight space.

Pricing was reasonable (dal @ 1095, Naan @270) .",positive
"Amazing Experience Staff-5/5 Food-5/5 Ambience-5/5 We ordered the famous Dal Bukhara and Pudhina naan, Paneer Stuffed Naan and Kulfi Faluda for Dessert. Awesomely delicious food. Going again for sure..!!",negative
"Went here on a Saturday night. It was packed, to say the least. Yays: Well the Daal Bukhara and Raan are good. I mean they are just good. Nays: Too crowded and noisy for a luxury experience. Food was okay. Nothing amazing. The raita was just yoghurt with cut onions and tomato on top. Also the service suffered with so many folks. Gulab jamun was toooo sweet. I won't say I had a bad experience. But for the price I was hoping for something better.",negative
"Bukhara is a favorite of my family's so we went last night to have our favorite food. First of all I must share that they do not take reservations after a certain time...so we could not reserve a table, however the reservations in charge put our name down in the list of people wanting to eat. Despite that on arrival the waiting time given was 45,mins to an hour. But they kindly seated us within 30 mins despite it being full. We had Chicken Malai Tikka, Dal Bukhara, Veg tandoori platter of Shimla Mirch and Gobi, raita, tandoori prawns, pudina laccha paranthas, stuffed onion kulcha. Everything was good except the dal missed it's signature deliciousness, the onion kulcha was chewy and not much flavor, so overall a good experience.",negative

Sutra is a really good place to visit in Noida for having great food and ambiance. They have a lot of seating capacity. The ambiance was too good. And Even the food was good. Service and hospitality was good. We tried Mushroom croquettes and pizza in appetisers and Mohito and Summer cooler in mocktail. Summer cooler was not good but all other items were. So overall a good experience. A recommended one. Plus they do have live music and DJ so that‚Äôs a plus point.,positive
"Really superb place. Very upscale decor and gives a feeling of luxury. The live band was so so good, don't have words to describe it.. simply awesome.. Food presentation is really out of this world, something that I have seem till now. Quality of food was too good and we were sad that our tummy were full but we wanted to eat more. Took away 1 star for service and pricing of non alcoholic drinks. I found non alcoholic drinks to be priced really high. Service was very slow and we ourselves had to find a place to sit. None of the waiters came to our help. But even after really bad Service, I'd definitely recommend this place.",positive
This place has all my ‚ô•Ô∏è. It's truly a spectacle to sit here and eat in the open rooftop. The food is very wholesome and mouth watering at the first sight.

"The ambiance of the place is good. They have indoor as well as outdoor rooftop seatings. We have decided to sit in the open and chooses the rooftop seating. We have ordered quite a few items along with drinks. We took Seekh kebab, Prawn tempura, Methi Chicken kebab. The prawn tempura was not at all tasty. Kebabs were fine but not that good. The service of the staff wasn't really appreciated. Not a recommendable place! Best wishes to these people anyways. :)",negative
"Factory by Sutra is located in sector 29, Gurgaon. This is a good place for a party. Factory has its own brewery and they serve fresh white beer and premium beer. Their bar offers a lot more from Black dog to Teachers to Johnny Walkers. The food menu has got it all. From pizzas to pastas to desserts. One thing that I liked the most was the chicken lollypop. It was tremendous. I also had pizzas and few starters. Food is commendable. Factory has a basement, then a floor with an open area and a rooftop seating area.",negative
"I have been to this place, experience was good, the food was okay, service can be improved. We found a hair in the food, so i think hygiene is one of the concern as we had our dinner quite late, when they switch on the lights and the DJ was stopped, otherwise it's very dark all the time, when people have their food. We were fortunate that we checked that food and found that hair in our main course. Ambiance is good and the overall experience is okay okay!",negative
As this is a micro brewery so it's a great place for beer lovers and good place for hangout. I have been to this place for lunch and it was okay type experience with the food. Ambience is nice and lively atmosphere. Here are my ratings; Veg tandoori platter - 3.5/5 Veg pizza with Indian topings- 4/5 Green Thai curry with rice- 4/5 Chinese salad- 3/5 this is deep fried noodles salad ‚òπÔ∏è Ambience- 4.5/5 Staff & services- 4/5,positive

Was here on a Monday evening with my friend. Happening place and good crowd. Had wine and crispy chicken bites. Both were good. The service was quick. Overall it's a good hangout place in Sector 29. Would visit again for trying out other things.,positive
I ordered chilli chicken n wheat beer . It was perfect blend of spices and right taste . Factory by sutra us a great place to chill n hang around with friends,positive
The place is nice and happening and the staff is also very courteous. Samosa spring rolls were good with a potato and peas filling served with imli chutney. The chilli paneer was also good.,positive
"The best thing here was their amazinglyyy designed menu!! Food- I ordered mutton tacos and a chicken pizza. Honestly, I have neverrrr had anything better than those tacos, they were next level!! But the pizza, wasn‚Äôt that great, it was bland. Ambience- The ambience of the place was very positive. It has a hugeee brewery which really attracts me! It also has a terraceeee!!! Service- The service wasn‚Äôt very fast. The service boy didn‚Äôt have a lot of knowledge about the dishes served there. But, dooooo visit for their mutton tacos!!!",positive

Sutra has never failed in showcasing it's uniqueness with its live performances and lip smacking food. We ordered different items from different cuisines and each item was worth ordering Drinks were beyond our expectations especially sweet 16. Most recommended place to hangout with friends or family or formal meetings. Timely services with remarkable suggestions from their side. In all visit was great and fun.,positive
"Visited this place with my friend for an office meeting. I was so impressed with the ambience and its decor. Soft music with positive vibes were there key factor at that place. For food we ordered pasta, Asian mains and 5 star fudge brownie for desserts Every item was worth ordering. I never had such amazing pasta in my life. My recommendation to all food lovers try there pasta once. Overall I had an amazing time with them.",positive
"Ambience is great here. Food menu is exciting. But overall service was quite slow. When we went the music played were plain sad songs not sure if that is there thing, Though band performance was great. Loved bajre Ka pizza found it exactly what was described and turned in great taste. Overall good experience.",negative
"A great place to unwind after work. Of the millions of times I've been here not one has been disappointing. Friday nights post work are great but the music can be a bit loud. The ambience in summers and winters is cosy and comfortable... Heck the place looks good even rain drenched. The drinks are priced a bit high if you're ordering outside the happy hours. They have recently revamped their food menu but the dishes are too risque. I'm not a fan of their food. Below are images of pizza (decent), drinks, chicken papdi, kung pao chicken, nachos (which change in taste and presentation every time we order them).",positive

Way over priced and taste just like the regular. This place is good only for the crowd and the ambiance both because of the high prices you can see the elite crowd here. But apart from that the food is just average nothing great but it is a pub afterall so keep that in mind.,positive
"Good enough place in Cyberhub. Pretty ambience. Might be an issue on weekends and you may need reservation to deal with that. Coming to food. It was nice. We order Alfredo Chicken Pasta, Mushroom Tower and Veggies from the wok. All of them were good. They were tasty but the cheese in all of them was on the higher side.",positive
"Had recently visited this place which I found astonishing and superior in the Cyber Hub area. This place offers a fine dine-in experience and has a lovely ambience which I truly loved. One of the best experience I had at this place. Went with some of my friends for casual dining. Now coming to food, had ordered their Chicken Reshmi Seekh Kebabs, Butter Chicken which came along with Khamere roti, papad, pickle, onions and raita. Food was delicious and amazing. In dessert, we ordered Tiramisu and Chocolate Lava Cake. Their Chocolate Lava cake is awesome. In drinks, we had ordered their Cocktails. Drinks were all tasting good.

"With a zeal to explore new cafes, we landed up on this one in Delhi. It has another outlet in Anand lok but we zeroed on this one due to its location. It is located in the Air Force hub and is open to civilian. The complex itself is very lovely and the small shops, parrots, all add to the ambience. We did not have to wait for lunch and easily got the place. Though booking is recommended towards evening. Dishes Ordered: Mushroom calzone, seashell mixed sauce pasta, tiramisu Top dish: Mushroom calzone The food is good and has a good texture to it. Pasta can definitely be improved upon but the ambience and service covers up for the venue. The price is a bit towards the higher side but it is worth it. Best part of the service is that restaurant doesn't try to push you out or stand upon you to continuously place an order or eat something. You can come with your group, eat, enjoy and relax.

I had a great experience here. It was a wonderful winter after noon and i was craving for a good coffee. My friend had recommended me this place many times and finally I visited this wonderful place. Its a really beautiful place with great ambience and good staff (very friendly & professional). Will be exploring their menu soon and will post. Its a must visit for those who haven't.

"So, this one was bookmarked since long but was not happening somehow, but finally we visited the place on a Saturday night and as one can see in the pictures its ambiance is even better. Its like the home has turned into a restaurant with both indoor and outdoor seating. Food and Drinks are good. we tried Virgin Sangria, Smoked mushroom soup,Grilled Tomato brochette , couple of more things I dont remember and yes Chicken Cordon Bleu Its just in front of Gargi college so u can expect a lot of college crowd in day time but Its TRP is its ambiance kind of which you find less in Delhi NCR.",positive
"My best friend took me to this place and I couldn't have been happier. It has a lively yet homely vibe that I absolutely adored and WHAT FOOD!!! I loved everything we ordered and it came in good portions so I wish I could have ordered more!!! We had jalape√±o poppers, zucchini fries, goat cheese and chicken and jalape√±o pizza. We had this with banana shake, berry berry smoothie (absolute favorite) and Oreo shake. For desserts we had banoffie pie and I never wanted to stop eating it. The ambience is amazing and I cannot stress how lovely it is visiting here.",positive
"Visited on a weekday and to my surprise the place was packed. When you reach diggin, you could tell right from outside how beautiful the place is with the trees and the fairy lights. There is a lot of seating space, outside, then there are two floors. In food we ordered a Farm fresh pizza and cheese garlic bread. Both were great, except for the fact that I didn‚Äôt like the small jalape√±o pieces on the pizza. Wish they were bigger slices so it would have been easier. For drinks we ordered a strawberry and mango smoothie which was delicious. The other one, virgin mojito was a bit tangier than expected.

The best of the ambience and the worst of the food. Don't know how could they spoil something as simple as nachos loaded with cheese on top. Chicken lollipop were terrible. Really terrible.

The chilli paneer they served could have been better if it was spicy. Spaghetti was good too.a must visit place.",positive

"This was the first time I went to Social and I have heard a lot bout their hashtags and their cool ambience. So when I went to this place I expected a little more than what it was to be there. The ambience was quiet chirpy, I mean literally the songs played were very low and all you could hear is people blabbering. May be this was one thing I disliked but people might enjoy. Coming to the food, I tried Chinese bhel, felt it had a lot of starch on it and this a little bland bit then amount was okayish and the manchurian balls were good. It was presented well too. Penne in curry vegetable - It was basic white sauce pasta as you have everywhere. The vegetable quantity was also just okayish.(I prefer a lot of veggies) 4 cheese pizza - This was good, liked the taste of basic cheese and pizza( Pizza is everyone's favourite obviously) Fresh lime soda - Good taste, had the fizz and my basic requirement.",negative

The lemonade was amazing. The death wings or devil's chicken - it was good spicy. I loved it. Could have gone for a little more spice. But still amazing. All in all, very recommended. Better than Hauz Khas social in terms of inner seatings. Cute place.",positive
Totally love this place for their theme and the unique food menu. At times we go there for breakfast or snacks than a beer.. Wish they could have a bigger place so that at least for once we don't have to wait.,positive

I had seekh kebab and mutton roll. Seekh kebab was tasty. And heavy . If u r having food from outside ..prices are less. If u want to go inside and sit. Prices are very high.,positive
"So I went specially to try this place all the way from noida to Safdarjung . I would say I was not disappointed. They are two options available in RDX , take away and sitting . Prices are like 1/3 less for take ways vs dining. So in the evening you will find many friends and family eating outside , standing outside ther car /bikes or sitting on the side stairs having food. We tried the dining area. Service was good , I liked veg as well though this place is famous for more of non veg food. Dahi kabab are really good, and so was the paneer tikka Lababdar In non veg we had galoiti kabab it was soft though I felt should have been cooked a little longer , chicken gravy was good though with Rogan josh types gravy. Service -5/5 Food -4/5 Price 4/5 Surely a good place to have a dinner . You would come out satisfied.",positive

Not only sweets but their expertise is north indian food, snacks, street food. Though i am guilty of not trying their golgappas. I ought to one day. Everything i tried was just exceptional and unique in it's own way. Love Chole bhature, Cold coffee, Pine apple pastry, Mango Kalakand, Chocolate truffle cake, Chocolate barfi, South Indian platter. Chinese platter and Pizza did not impress me that much. I specifically like Manchurian among all all other things. They can compete with other big brands of food industry. The burger is a small and simple preparation of Rs. 30/- It is addictive. They also prepare muffins on occasions, gift packs of cookies are delicious.",positive

Tried this bright and beautiful ice cream dessert by the name of Hawaiian Fantasy that consists of 4 different flavors of ice creams with respective syrups and lots of nuts on top. The highlight of this dessert apart from the quantity of ice creams is that it is served in a holllowed pine apple which justifies it's name and gives a Hawaiian feel. We love eating this one dish from here apart from their all time famous dodha and milkcake mithai.,positive

"I do not remember myself going to an old school type Indian restaurant in the recent past ever since other more contemporary restaurants are opened in plethora. But, this Saturday on demand of my family to have a family lunch I went there. This restaurants is best in class when it comes to Vegetarian food. The best part about this restaurant is that it tends to offer more than many varieties of cuisine such as Chinese ( Indian Style), South Indian, North Indian and other quick India snacks delicacies. And not to forget, the sweets served here are just mouth melting. Overall, I enjoyed every morsel I had here from every item we ordered. A must go place for every vegetarian food lover. Guys, you must try their Thalis, be it India or Chinese .......",positive

"This place is best for friends and family fine dine. They serve varieties of starters , main course and sweet treats. Staff were really good. Although service was slow but it was sunday. Cheese cake and Raspberry cake was divine. I don‚Äôt like the marinate on the grill because they taste similar in all the starters. They celebrate birthdays with a pirate hat which is very creative.",positive
Food is awesome Pirates Grill is providing more dishes as compared to relevant Buffet grill restaurants.Tables were always occupied .i feel it was a good taste must try place.,positive
"This is Mall on India, ambience is good and nice welcome. Spread is very good for Non Veg. Starters are served on table on grill. Taste is good but due to weekend it was full and service was slow. Main course was good l like black dal and Chinese which was made live",positive
This is one of the best buffet place we've ever visited. Pirates of the grill steals my heart witu every visit. All the starters whether veg or non veg are anazing. I just didn't like the dimsum last time but ai hope they improvise in the next visit. Planning to have lunch soon there.,positive
"I think giving 5 stars is too less for this place. When It comes to buffet this is the best place to visit. They serve absolutely amazing and delicious food. They have a lot to offer in their menu whether it be starters, main course or Desserts. Decent ambience, Live music and the tasty food! It's very reasonable as compared to the food they offer. My favorites are Salsa potato, chicken tangri and brownies, etc #highonbite",positive

"A vast variety of menu of all cuisines is what makes Pirates of Grill unparalleled and impeccable. Notably, the multitudes of non-veg and desserts appealed to me. Just a few shortcomings ‚Äî there was too much oil in halwa, and the lamb was undercooked. Hope you improve upon it. Rest everything was exotic.",positive
"The restaurant serves lunch and dinner buffets which are affordable and worth it absolutely. The starters are mainly good which has paneer tikka, soya chaap, tandoori pineapple, stuffed mushrooms, etc. The main course is also good but, most of the people skip it. The desserts are worth with a combination of different types of cakes and indian delicacies like jalebi and rabri.",positive
I have visited this place twice and I love their food and ambience. This place generally too much overcrowded and that too I went on Saturday night so there was waiting for about hour but for the food they serve it‚Äôs absolutely worth it,positive

"This place doesn't know how to maintain the decorum. Nobody literally cares how to manage the crowd. Coming to the food point of view, starters firstly served were cold, which seemed like it was kept for a long, after that the starters were ok and they have a very limited main course option which does not qualify the taste buds. Dessert options are slight sober as this made me give 3 stars. Rest the ambience was in a haphazard state.",negative
"Food :4 Ambience :3.5 Service : 3.5 We went there for team lunch. The dimsums were delicious üòã. Pineapple üçç was as usual good. The kebabs melted in the mouth ü§©. In main course, the mutton curry üçõ was the best. The pieces were luscious and soft. The chicken Biryani tasted good too which is quite unusual. The brownie was also yum. Overall a good place for buffets .",positive
"It is one of the oldest barbeque restaurant in gurgaon and it is still the best. Good service , amazing food, lots of variety. All packed of Wednesday's afternoon. Today sticky lemon fish was too good. Must try !",positive
This is the perfect place for tandoori food and north Indian food lovers. I have been to this place for dinner and it was a nice experience with this restaurant. This restaurant serves buffet so you can eat unlimited tandoori starters and main course. Staff is very courteous and provides quick services. Good place for small family celebrations. Everything is good about this place. Unlimited good at very reasonable price üôÇ,positive
Went to this place on a team lunch .. The menu of this place is good and have a lot of options .. Service is a just fine not so quick .. The quality of the food did not impress me much . Quality needs to be improved,negative
"Good place for foodie,as food was served as buffet form. Pros: taste, ambience,crowd As i was visited in world cup time they had multiple LED's to watch matches. Live music was good as generally i didn't see these type of performance in buffet(casual dine) restaurant. Cons: management ,staff service as they wont repeat food in proper way,lack of service. We called couple of times to repeat starter. Waiting for long some starters. Food: starter:i love the corn,prawn in starter dislike grilled pineapple. Imp: they serve 5-6 varities of sauces which we loved most. Main course was overall good. Desert- pudding and apple pie must eat,halwa was also good as it was not too sweet. At the end serving kulfi must try.",negative
The starters were too good. There were lots of them starting from prawn to corn to momo and so on. Taste is good. I went there on a Saturday and the service was slow due to huge crowd. Overall there a huge variety and I would love to go there again.,positive
"I really liked this place. It's very important to maintain taste and standard in each item in buffet, and they are doing it quite well. Everything was delicious specially dessert section, paneer Tikka, pineapple Tikka and baked potato. Service is something they can improve more, but it's was jam packed weekend so it's understandable.",positive

"A really nice and cozy place...well lit with natural light in the day and happening atmosphere with finger licking good food at a reasonable price. What's more - this place offers a traditional Persian way of eating in form of dastarkhwan. Nice and humble staff serving with happy and charming smile is really an awesome sight as well. Parking is a real problem for the entire market - but it's really not restaurant problem though. Recommend to take a cab and give this place a try. Also, they have a real large menu for mutton lovers and comparitively less chicken items.",positive
"Ever Tried Kababs with Rice? Heard it Right. . Nooshe joon, New Delhi. . Tried their best ‚ÄúBakhtiyari Mutton Kabab‚Äù . Super delicious. You may feel it bit spicy nd soury in taste but yes it‚Äôs speciality of these KababS. They served it with flavoured rice which is a great mix with Kabab. First time ever tried Kabab with Rice. . ‚ÄúMutton Korma‚Äù .. Boneless mutton pieces and it was really very soft and easily chewable. Best Mutton KormA I‚Äôve ever had.

"Found the place upto the expectation. The ambience was superb and the food was smokin wicked. It's everything one would expect from middle eastern cuisine. The flavours were outstanding. Hummus and tatziki were too good. The meter long kebab had enough meat and rice for 4. Also tried mutton qorma which was unlike anything most of the Indians are acquainted with. It was a silky tomato gravy seasoned with black pepper only. Not many options for vegetarians, but hey who is complaining? Highly recommended. We for sure are coming back.",positive
"Nooshe Joon : situated in the hustle bustle lane of Lajpat Nagar or mini afghanistan . Despite being owned by Indian , the taste is very much authentic of Afghanistan. Staff is very friendly & ready to serve with smile & lots of efforts. Hats off to Danish & Tarannum for running a such wonderful place with hint of Afghanistan & Persia in their foods . Last but not the least to mention the complimentary green tea after the food was helpful in metabolism activity.",positive
"Tucked away in a remote part of Lajpat Nagar and in fact close to my other favourite haunt,Afghan Darbar, is this huge Iranian - Afghan eatery. It‚Äôs clean, air conditioned, comfortable and accessible. It was a Monday and the place was quite full. You can tell if a regional place is authentic given the type of people who inhabit it. Much like Gung - The Palace which is Korean and Circle of Friends which is Sichuan Chinese this place was full of people from the Middle East. We focused on the Iranian part of the menu - Lamb Kibbeh and Chicken with Rice. Accompanied by Bamya and Aubergine with Afghan Roti and beautiful aromatic rice. I could literally swim in food such as this. Succulent pieces of meat and chicken with lightly seasoned rice and the vegetables a perfect 10 on 10. You complete me Nooshe Joon.",positive
Fabulous fabulous fabulous ....... only that‚Äôs the world to describe this jewel for any bar be que foodie...... everything served is a carnivores delight ..... the place is made to give that Mediterranean feel specially the sit down options that are unique Specially to mention Danish the owner And Shahil.

"Found this place while looking for an afghani cuisine restaurant. They food was average and even though there were only 2 tables full in afternoon, the service was slow. Their dishes are typical, please ask before ordering. We ordered: Spinach cheese fatayer ( the only delicious dish according to me, must try this one) Mutton korma ( nothing like the usual mutton korma one would expect, more like masala mutton. You can skip this one) Zatar kabab ( quite bland and rawish) They serve things with free kabuli roti In drinks, we ordered: Watermelon lemonade (okayish) Lemon ice tea ( too sweet and bad) Oreo king shake (better than other drinks) Also, the owners had their own rules for zomato gold which is frustrating because they dont go by zomato gold rules. All in all , okay experience not too great I prefer going to mazaar for better afghani food which is just adjacent to this place.",negative
This place has a lively atmosphere and it seems to be doing good business. The hospitality here is very good the staff is very friendly. Coming to the food we ordered the jujeh kebab which had a very refreshing sour twist to it and the Chopaan Mutton kebab which were basically lamb chops. The meat in the chopaan kebab came of the bone very easily but parts of the meat were a tad bit overcooked which made it hard. We also ordered the pulao which had a different kind of flavour. To end things we had their Iranian tea which was aromatic. To end it all this place is worth it for the price they serve their food at,positive

Indian accent is a place you must keep in mind for special occasions. It surely became a memorable experience. I went for veg and non veg chef‚Äôs platter as I want more interested in trying a variety and I want disappointed in my choice. When visiting Indian accent do keep in mind to enjoy the experience and not be bothered by the small quantity of the food. I would recommend it a 100%.,positive
"A very delightful evening at Indian Accent. From courteous service to beautiful flavours , it's an experience which is worth taking. Cheers to the chef and his team for creating a new wave in Indian cuisine calling it Modern Indian. Loved everything i tried. Tofu vadai, crispy chaat with ragda and watermelon, ghee roast soya boti with rumali pancake. Everything was so satisfying. Got a complimentary dessert, dualat ki chaat which is apparently a famous old delhi dish, a light creamy dessert, full of flavours. Last but not the Least, dodha burfi tart with fresh vanilla bean icecream took my palette to a different world üòÑ. Will be visiting again to try more.",positive

"Great ambiance, and great food. Indian Accent has always been one of my favorites. So, during my last visit this is what I had and liked.

"When your girlfriend is in the mood for Indian and you gotta represent Delhi - this, is the no brainer answer. We opted for their 6 course menu and believe me, it was the best. We took the vegetarian and the non-vegetarian options, just to explore everything. Our favourites - the crab with sago, the silken tofu medu vada and the treacle. Incidentally, the medu vada and the treacle were off the set menu, so we got lucky. The Benares chaat... Naah... She thought it was bhaaji, without any pav... :P The service was fantastic and the experience was brilliant. Must try, of you haven't!",positive
"Located as a standalone restaurant at the lodhi, the panoramic view of the serene waterfront is really comforting to the eyes, has a really vibrant and upbeat contemporary feel to it. They have updated their menu and the food tastes great. Top all of this with efficient customer service.",positive
"Finally we went for Dinner at Indian Accent. And honestly it didn't justify the #1 Restaurant in India Tag for me. We ordered 1. Medu Tofu Vada : Tofu was perfectly minced and I really liked it. 2. Mirchi Starter : Not my taste at all. It was like Green Chillies filled with cheese 3. Pao Bhaji : Pretty regular flavour with extra tanginess 4. Chicken Chettinad Keema Vermicelli : Keema was nice, just the combo of Vermicelli didn't appeal much to me. 5. Daulat Ki Chaat : The highlight of our experience. It was nice, light and Foamy. The service is good, the ambience of restaurant in decent and they also provide complimentary blue cheese Naan starters and palate cleanser in form of Alu Bukhara Chuski. I was just not as impressed, as I was really looking forward to it.",negative

Had high expectations Lemme list the positives: Nice ambience Quick service Okayish music Nice dance floor Good seating Negatives: Food was not good (sply baby corn starter) We asked for seats in the inside area first, they said it's a private party. But when we got up to leave cuz I couldn't take the heat, they suddenly said there is a table available inside :D That shows they save up the tables for late night And ofcourse they were out of kingfisher and blenders pride (such a scam) on a weekend They 'mistakenly' brought more shots to my drunk friend and tried to charge for it So, a pretty nice place, could be better with good food and an honest hospitality",negative

The ambience is very pretty. They have seating areas shaped like a small piece of a honey comb which is pretty unique. The decor is nice overall. I have been to this place multiple times.

Service was nice and staff were very decent. Average serving time is around 15-20 mins. Service is here is moderately quick and very decent staff. One of the major advantage is ample of parking space. Its always crowded on wednesday. Great ambiene, great music, great food. All in all a must visit on a weekend. Plus they have ZomatoGold too!",positive

So that people do not get fooled by the misleading rating and get to know the reality of this sick place!,negative
"BEWARE!! .......This place had a hidden camera in the women‚Äôs washroom. The girl who saw it, her review was deleted.............. BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",negative
Hidden Camera in Women Washroom. Horrible,negative
"Place is huge and nice. Had high expectations Lemme list the positives: Nice ambience Quick service Okayish music Nice dance floor Good seating Negatives: Food was not good (sply baby corn starter) We asked for seats in the inside area first, they said it's a private party. But when we got up to leave cuz I couldn't take the heat, they suddenly said there is a table available inside :D That shows they save up the tables for late night And ofcourse they were out of kingfisher and blenders pride (such a scam) on a weekend They 'mistakenly' brought more shots to my drunk friend and tried to charge for it So, a pretty nice place, could be better with good food and an honest hospitality",negative
We went to this place for a friday evening dinner and it happened to be good place with cool ambience Though the veg food which we ordered from starters to main course was pretty fine but salad made my day rough It was smelling rotten and the lettuce was also not good enuf.. bad experience in salad,negative
Overall Rating: 3/5 Ambience : 4/5 Food : 3.5/5 Service 3.5/5 Value for Money : ‚Çπ‚Çπ‚Çπ Dishes Ordered: ‚Ä¢ Peri peri fries ‚Ä¢ Paneer chilly ‚Ä¢ Veg Crispy ‚Ä¢ Veg nachos ‚Ä¢ Paneer tikka pop corn This place is in between the hustling roads of Hinjewadi. The ambience is very pretty. They have seating areas shaped like a small piece of a honey comb which is pretty unique. The decor is nice overall. I have been to this place multiple times. So I have had various experiences at this place. The twice I had been before the food was amazing and the music was nice too. During those visit had ordered the tikka pop corn which was amazing and the veg nachos. Recently I had been there the food seemed pretty okay.,negative
"Visited this place twice. Had an amazing experience.Very good ambience nice experience all together I will recommend my friends and colleagues visit this place .Nice place to hangout with friends and family.located near by amsterdam. i've been there last month so i had to write about it, i had Desi Chilli Panner,Veg Manchow Soup ,Paneer Tikka Masala,The Paneer Makhani Casseroll,Butter Naan. Service was nice and staff were very decent. Average serving time is around 15-20 mins. Service is here is moderately quick and very decent staff. One of the major advantage is ample of parking space. Its always crowded on wednesday. Great ambiene, great music, great food. All in all a must visit on a weekend. Plus they have ZomatoGold too!",positive
"The interiors of restaurants are getting better and better with each passing day. And Behive is one such example wherein you will be amazed to see how fabulously this place has been decorated. The seating areas, the lounge space.. the hexagons built on different levels are completely new in concept and appealing to the eyes. Also they serve great food.. wherein Chinese is highly recommended. üòçüòã",positive
"Firstly management is extremely good they were very kind to provide table where ever we wanted. Service was very fast and dish was tasty too chilly chicken, khurana chicken,nachos, penne white pasta, fries masala, corn masala all were too good DJ was also great spacious to dance and ambience was nice",positive
"Regarded as one of the best chain of buffet restaurants in town, it definitely lived up to its expectations. Right from the starters till the very end of the desserts, all the items served were real delicacies. Despite being a total non veg buff, all the veg items which I tried were also very good. In addition to all these, the centre of attraction were the availability of Shark fish, Octopus,Quail, Duck, Bunny and Emu.",positive
"Visited for friends Birthday, the staff was very polite and courteous. The starters were to die for and had a lot of options to choose from. Wish grill was a unique touch and pastas both were good. Deserts were okayish and main course could have been better. All and all the experience was delightful and DO RECOMMEND a visit",positive
"I visited this place many times with my friends for Lunch and Dinner. I had huge expectations since many of my friends told me that this is the best Barbeque. Brazilian festival as going on when I visited this place and it was too good. I tried almost all the Non-Veg starters like Amuse-bouche, Mushroom cappuccino, Crispy corn chat, Vermicelli cheese ball, Honey chili pineapple, Paneer pasanda grill, Tandoor mushroom, Chilli parsley prawn, Thecha Mutter Tikki. In Veg, I tried Mashed Potato and Grilled pineapple. In desserts, I tried Matka Phirni, Gulab jamoon, Chocolate pastry, Vanilla Ice cream, Paan Kulfi, and Kulfi Falooda. Non-Veg starters were too good. Veg starters were okay for me.",positive
"If you're looking for an all-you-can-eat buffet, maybe you should give this place a try. Let me tell you why. AB's stands out among the buffet restaurants with its wish grill and exotic meats ranging from shark meat to rabbit meat. Among the vegetarian options, there is the quick wok where you can choose the vegetables and sauces and the chef prepares it exactly the way you like it. You will find a barbecue grill on your table where you can grill the starters yourselves. Do check out the chaat station as well. The main course is average with the usual breads, rice and curry. But when it comes to desserts, you won't be disappointed. Every month AB's keeps a theme for their buffet and I happened to go for the Brazilian food carnival this time. I was delighted to find some typical Brazilian delicacies like the cheesy bread, pastels and empadas. Special mention to the servers at AB's for their warm hospitality and quick service.",negative
"Customer service was upto the mark, celebrated bday n danced, after a wait of one year n high rated reviews, the food was not even average. Terrible flavors, ambience is so clustered n dark. That need to improve the food n its quality. main course was again not acceptable. Thank god i went on Monday during the offer. Don't try to go and waste money",negative
"It's my first time in Absolute Barbecues and I am really overwhelmed by the quality of the food being served by them. The variation is good and upto the industry standards. But the quality of their food, specially the starters and the live grill was very nice. And worth mentioning. The hospitality is very good. I think a bit can be improved in the desert section.

A good buffet place for party time. Had lunch and it was fully crowded. Ambience is not much attractive as it is not much spacious. They offered complementary mocktail (either strawberry/kiwi/leachy/orange). Good options available in starter for vegetarian. Limited options in main course. Dessert are quite good. Pan icecream was good in taste. Live counter also available.,positive

"First visit.Great ambiance.fine service. The staff was very courteous and well known but was struggling to keep up with all the tables. I would have loved to see more options in the barbecue section. The starters were okay, except for the honey cardamom pineapple which was just fab. The main course was little underwhelming, The Biryani was nice but everything else was okay (-1 star) I had literally finished my main course when I was asked if I would like to have a Roti/Nan. (A flag system would help here.)they also served white sauce pasta on the request but it was too sweet for my liking. The desserts were delicious and good and had decent variety. I have mostly clicked the desserts because I was too hungry when we got there :DDo try the Paan ice-cream Overall - Great place, would visit again.Recommended? Yes.",positive
"Decent place to enjoy buffet with team. Recommended for team parties. Non-veg has lots of varieties. Desserts has very limited varieties. One -ve was alcohol was not allowed at that time. In one line, bit pricey but if you want to hog on food place is for you.",negative
"Absolute Barbeque can get better.. it's high time they should understand it isn't easy to compete with Barbeque Nation. The basic starter like crispy corn, chicken tandoor can get better. Dessert option should be increased. Main course is just okay. Pasta, noodles were good. This place serves duck, emu, rabbit, octopus etc as option which makes it outshine other places. Service is commendable. Ambience is also good. Food needs to be improved. They serve complimentary cake also if needed.",negative
Food was good..menu was normal.nothing exiting to offer. I had the menu for 549 since its a weekday and was worth it. Ambiance good Hospitality good Just expected a better variation in menu.,negative
"This is definitely a good place for barbeque lovers. With the normal barbeque they also severs different types of meat like octopus,shark,duck, rabbit and sea food.",positive
"I am the regular customer of this hotel.. Just want to mention staff was so Courteous, decent ambiance, good variety of food. We had a prior booking through zomato, however we got our table after 15mins of reservation time. There were many option in non veg section, everything was good except 'Duck' option. I was the only veg person amongs us, i felt they were limited and options in veg section. Mocktail were tasteless, i think they made it in water / soda only. They added too much lemons in Lemon ice tea. Service was propmt and waiters were keep asking about our requirments. Management : if possible please add few options in veg section like : fried paneer items, chinese starters, soya chaap varieties, etc... Worth to visit here.",positive
Awesome place ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏èthe only place where we get duck and rabbit and shark....ü§©ü§©all the food was super awesomely tasty. The starters and the wings and the chats and the final and the best part of dinner .......the desert and the ice cream .,positive
"Hey there 100th review! Went to this place to celebrate my birthday. I had already been to AB's other outlets and knew how good their food usually is. But unfortunately this branch's food wasn't upto my expectations. This doesn't mean that it was bad. It was good but just not upto my expectations The starters on the grill were decent, but the starters off the grill were better comparatively. We tried a horde of veg and non-veg starters. The live counter as usual had different types of meats which is what AB's is famous for. Most of them were pretty good, though rest of them were really disappointing. The main course was average, but who really goes for the main course in a Barbeque restaurant. The desserts again as usual stole the show. Incredible taste and consistency. There were variety of desserts available in the desserts counter and none of them disappointed me. In all a good place to go with your friends and family especially on special occasions.",positive
We were here for their Brazilian food festival to try some Brazilian cuisines. We really liked the starters and they also have live counter where you can customize your dish. The main course was also good. In desserts we really liked the paan icecream. #puneritravellers,positive
"I visited absolute Barbeque when the Brazilian festival was going on. Street festival having golgappas, tikki, dahi bhalla etc. It has an amazing ambience with good hospitality. The food is really tasty and good . They have variety of things over a Barbeque. In veg they have paneer, mushroom, fruits like guava, watermelon and pineapple. In non veg from prawns to sharks they have a variety of Barbecue. The starters are too good. Fried corn is my favourite. In main course they have good options to try. Amazing variety of breads. Variety of desserts is just OMG!!!! They have really good desserts. From pastries to rasmalai everything is just yumm. They have special paan ice cream which is worth having in the mouth. Biryani is really good. I liked the kofta. Really good. The staff is very sweet. The staff takes care of every customer whenever they need anything. Dance of the boys is fun part in the absolute barbecue. Mocktails are good. PS: Follow me on instagram - @smartchief_",positive
"We had so much fun at absolute barbecue season mall.We just loves their food .They have verity of food in veg ,no veg , desserts .The staffs also very cooperative and was doing very good service .overall very good experience.",positive
"Visited this restaurant during Brazilian Food Festival. They serve different live starters on the grill on table. Taste is very good for fish, chicken and prawns starters. They also have wish grill where you can choose different ingredients and make your dish. This wish grill includes shark fish, octopus, quill, emu and duck meat along with different ingredients like bell pepper, onion. etc. Main course is having variety. I liked the crab curry. It was awesome in taste. They also provide crab cutters. Desserts too have many options to choose from right from the cakes to the gulablam and shira. They also have live ice cream counter. I liked the baked alaska and paan ice cream. Apart from this, they also have live pizza and pasta counter. Service is very quick. Staff is courteous and prompt. Ambiance is very nice, vibrant and attractive. Overall, very nice option to have an altogether different experience of barbecue along with some other exciting options.",positive
"There food is very good... Specially the love counters are awesome .... They serve you customized veg/non veg starters and prepare anything that you desire and is not in the menu.. excellent staff, very humble.... Especially the steward VEERU.... He is delighed to help you and serve you better..",positive
I had a great experience at this restaurant! From the food to the service everything was flawless! The starters and desserts were the best! The chocolate balls were my favourite from the dessert! The thing that makes this restaurant stand out is the exotic non veg live counter. You can make dishes of your choice and enjoy them!,positive
"Food: 5/5 Ambience: 4/5 Service: 5/ 5 We loved the place, especially service and food. Wide range of food items for veg and non-veg lovers from duck to sharks :) Amazing Food. The live counter was serving duck, quail, rabbit, octopus and shark which you cannot get to try anywhere else. Apart from this, live counter also serves Pani Puri, Kachori, Pasta and other few items. Desserts are amazing here. Staff is really concerned about the food you ear and they will also customize the food in terms of taste and all for you as per your suggestion. Quality of the food is also really good. Overall amazing experience and it's a must visit place.",positive
"Visited them with family today had a good time. The prawns and fish starters were nice. So was the wish grill we tried shark fish, octopus and duck. The lemon coriander.chixkwn soup was lovely and the dahi puri was good. In main course goan shrimp curry and Dahi bhalla was really good. Deserts were very nice especially the Pan icecream. Overall we had a good time. Updating gee photos I clicked.",positive
"Review No: 167 We decided to go to absolute barbecue to try different option than usual choice for team lunch. All people were well greeted & seated. Menu had barbecue, main course, desert & a complementary mocktail. Overall a good experience with food variety, taste & service. One thing I would suggest AB team is to improvise their chat counter. It really is is bad if you know what really chat is ! Good to see AB Team doing a live dance with music for their customers. VFM : 4/5 Taste : 3.5/5 Ambience:4/5 Service : 4/5 Overall: 4/5",positive
Crunchy Mirch Chicken Pakoda @cafeco2 I just totally loved the ambience because its very specious and center of attraction is lakeside seating area. Well why wouldn't someone like to sip beer and smoke hookah by the lake? There's sand on the ground which gives a better feel. Music isn't too loud which paves way for conversations.They have herbal hookah as well. All hookah lovers will surely love this place. So do visit such amazing place guys.,positive
A huge and beautiful place located right next to the manas lake which makes it a must visit for any weekend outing with friends and family. The food is amazing and the drinks are surely unique. Loved tthe chocolate wontons and kimchi salad. The black murg musallam is too good to describe. The music and ambience is pretty and surely tops for any outing choice.,positive
I went here for shisha offcourse. But not a great experience as we were on zomato gold they didn't treated well .the service was slow. food was not good. Music was off in the afternoon. The person who was taking our order was literally rude . The place is much hyped cz of social media influences but they didn't treated their guest well. Negative review from my side. Overall ambience was good . The main drawback is service. They should improve it . Food 2/5 Service 2/5 Ambience 3.5/5,negative
This place needs no introduction. Most famous place for Hookah in Pune. Along with Hookah this place also has a wide variety of food options. Especially the non-veg one.,positive

The biggest restaurant i have seen in my life till now. Quick service. Great food. Gives you feeling of a shack. A dance floor for all. Alotted family section. Experienced DJ playing numbers around the globe. Service 4* Food 4* Ambience 3.5* Value for money 4*,positive
Best place to visit with friends i personally will not prefer kids as all table usually order hookah and the crowd is all young people so not a great choice for family. Place is located pretty out side of the main city and the main road but they have good number of bouncers available making it a safe place. I would suggest to go by car if you are going on a bike make sure you have a group of members as the road till this place is very dark in the night with no street lights throughout. This place serves hookah with some amazing flavours. They have dance floor open up till 12. We had been there on a Friday and they had amazing Bollywood music playing throughout the night.

"From many days, I wanted to visit this place and Finally me and my partner decided to go for this place. Trust me it has got outstanding ambience. The Service was little late but Apart from that everything was perfect. What we ordered was- When We actually went it was very cold outside so thought to order some soup.. So we had very Hot Manchow soup in such a cold weather. It was awesome. I will give it 5/5 Later we ordered below items- Paneer Bharwan-4/5 Veg Angara- 5/5 Virgin colada-4/5 You must visit this place. It also has Dance floor.

"This place has amazing ambience. When I say amazing I really mean amazing. üôà There are around 6/7 sitting areas designed in a beautiful way. If you wanna hangout with your buddies, or you want to go on a date or you want to just relax after a tiring day then this is the place for you with ample options. Let's talk about food. So me and my friends tried following dishes: 1. paneer makhani bao and it was the best bao I have tried till date. (Must try) 2. pumpkin ravioli was very different in taste and was delectable. 3. Ghee roast chicken was tasty. 4. peppery prawns was equally rich in taste. 5. American corn was ordinary. Let's talk about drinks now, So I have tried Plum lady and it was very refreshing. Juniper, was also refresing. And last but not least, Don't leave the place without having desserts. As they have tempting and mouth watering desserts. I have tried Banofee pie and trust me it was delectable .(Must try)",positive
"It was a Saturday night, my friends and I searching for a good restaurant to chill and have a dinner. So I found this restaurant on zomato. I think this is the newly open restaurant and there was a private party going on the other side of the restro. I don't know about the normal days but on that day there was heavy music. Anyways. On the front they have nice wall texture which gives the Amsterdam vibes. But inside they have Bamboo for support which is the black spot in beautiful interior. Now the main part THE FOOD. I did not expected much but I got surprised. Only thing I did not like is we ordered on dish but they took so long that eventually we cancelled it. Each and every dish we ordered was up to the mark. Overall experience was beyond my expectations. Ambience = 3/5 Food = 4.5/5 Service = 3/5",positive
"This is a very happening place with delicious food and top notch friendly service by the stewards and the managers. I visited this place yesterday evening where we met Swarna our steward who was very polite friendly and suggested us good things to eat. We had a great 1st time experience. Hence we visited them again today, they had bollywood night by DJ Shreya. Second time as well the service food and the dance floor were awesome with happening crowd. We had great time here. Keep it up...",positive
Ambience: Honestly speaking didn't like the ambience..They need to increase the light.. Interior was ok ok...I dint find any wao factor.. Food: Full Loaded nachos: Fully disappointed as taste was blunt.. Shanghai Paneer was suggested by Rupesh which was spicy n good too.. Drinks: Plum lady: 4.5/5 From paris with love: 4/5 Service: Fast n quick being week days.. People go there for ambience and food... But both are missing the Wao factor...,negative
"This place looks like a playhouse from the outside and a wonderland from the inside. It is absolutely stunning. Coming to the food, we ordered grilled prawn tacos, 8 hours braised lamb shank with pilaf rice and jus, charred pomfret with quinoa rice and fried okra. The tacos were like a modern Indian twist to traditional Mexican tacos with the tandoor prawns and the sweet chutney like dip. In main course, the braised lamb shank was the show stealer and I would recommend it to whoever goes there. Last but not the least, we had panna cotta which was decent but certainly not the best dish here. Overall, it's a very beautiful place to hang out with friends along with expensive but decent food.",positive
This is a very very instagramable place to begin with. It is very spacious with outdoor seating as well. Though I would suggest them to change their menu cards as they looked very shabby. Food offerings are majorly indian and italian. We ordered: Fully Loaded Nachos Paneer Tikkaikka Chicken Quesadillas The size of portion is adequate to the prices. They don't have zomato gold but have in-house offers on beer and sangrias. I tried rose wine sangria (2+1). My rating: Food: 4 Ambience: 5 Service: 3 Overall: 4,positive
"Decent place to spend time with your loved ones..!!!‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è Excellent ambience...!!!!....It has a huge place having different sections for dine out. Unique view at entrance where you can take as much photos as you want. Best part which I found was it's fast service. Well behaved staffs. In starter, Old School Chicken Tikka is must. Consisting of 8 pieces and the taste was amazing. Chooza 69 was similar to drums of heaven having a lot of Curry leaves. In main course, Delhi Street Butter Chicken was best with butter naan. It was worth visiting. I would love to suggest others to visit.",positive
Waoooo just amazing place to hang out with friends and Must visiting place in Hinjewadi .superb food nice service and ambiance is just killer. Masala peanuts and king fish Tikka was awesome. Superb place for party people . Cheers I Amsterdam üçª c u soon...,positive
"This place has amazing ambience. When I say amazing I really mean amazing. üôà There are around 6/7 sitting areas designed in a beautiful way. If you wanna hangout with your buddies, or you want to go on a date or you want to just relax after a tiring day then this is the place for you with ample options. Let's talk about food. So me and my friends tried following dishes: 1. paneer makhani bao and it was the best bao I have tried till date. (Must try) 2. pumpkin ravioli was very different in taste and was delectable. 3. Ghee roast chicken was tasty. 4. peppery prawns was equally rich in taste. 5. American corn was ordinary. Let's talk about drinks now, So I have tried Plum lady and it was very refreshing. Juniper, was also refresing. And last but not least, Don't leave the place without having desserts. As they have tempting and mouth watering desserts. I have tried Banofee pie and trust me it was delectable .(Must try)",positive
"It was a Saturday night, my friends and I searching for a good restaurant to chill and have a dinner. So I found this restaurant on zomato. I think this is the newly open restaurant and there was a private party going on the other side of the restro. I don't know about the normal days but on that day there was heavy music. Anyways. On the front they have nice wall texture which gives the Amsterdam vibes. But inside they have Bamboo for support which is the black spot in beautiful interior. Now the main part THE FOOD. I did not expected much but I got surprised. Only thing I did not like is we ordered on dish but they took so long that eventually we cancelled it. Each and every dish we ordered was up to the mark. Overall experience was beyond my expectations. Ambience = 3/5 Food = 4.5/5 Service = 3/5",positive
"This is a very happening place with delicious food and top notch friendly service by the stewards and the managers. I visited this place yesterday evening where we met Swarna our steward who was very polite friendly and suggested us good things to eat. We had a great 1st time experience. Hence we visited them again today, they had bollywood night by DJ Shreya. Second time as well the service food and the dance floor were awesome with happening crowd. We had great time here. Keep it up...",positive
Ambience: Honestly speaking didn't like the ambience..They need to increase the light.. Interior was ok ok...I dint find any wao factor.. Food: Full Loaded nachos: Fully disappointed as taste was blunt.. Shanghai Paneer was suggested by Rupesh which was spicy n good too.. Drinks: Plum lady: 4.5/5 From paris with love: 4/5 Service: Fast n quick being week days.. People go there for ambience and food... But both are missing the Wao factor...,negative
"This place looks like a playhouse from the outside and a wonderland from the inside. It is absolutely stunning. Coming to the food, we ordered grilled prawn tacos, 8 hours braised lamb shank with pilaf rice and jus, charred pomfret with quinoa rice and fried okra. The tacos were like a modern Indian twist to traditional Mexican tacos with the tandoor prawns and the sweet chutney like dip. In main course, the braised lamb shank was the show stealer and I would recommend it to whoever goes there. Last but not the least, we had panna cotta which was decent but certainly not the best dish here. Overall, it's a very beautiful place to hang out with friends along with expensive but decent food.",positive

"Went to social on Wednesday evening. Ambience was great and I'll say one of the best place. Food was great as expected. Tried chakna tiffin, chilli paneer, chilli chicken, roasted chicken and kebab. All the items taste good. In drinks, after a lot of deliberations, staff somehow convinced us to go for bada khamba i.e. full bottle of Ballantine finest. Just cautious on this aspect and agree only if group can finish full bottle. Overall its a great experience",positive

Social naam he kaafi hai. They have kept their legacy wherever they go. Undoubtedly it's a best chain of restaurants in India. You will never be disappointed with the service or food. Everytime I visit social I always feel positive vibes about this chain. Do visit anywhere FC road branch or Viman nagar branch.,positive
"The ambience is lovely and happening. You will find all kind of crowd in socials from youth to families enjoying their own happy time. Their food is good, be it italian or Indian.

"A perfect hangout place. There are no cons as such just that service is slow on weekends. Detailed review, Food - Just awesome. We spent most of our time with munchies. Fries, crispy corn, chaat. Each and every prep was great. Nice presentation and taste. Ambience - It's tye best part here and tye main attraction. Crowd is very ""fancy"" and ""high society"" but this place fits everyone in. Perfect place to chill. The theme with green lights and vintage seating feels great. There are different seating arrangements and each one is unique and nice.

These small things matter to me a lot since it tells you character of a place and professionalism of the staff.",negative
"Ambience: 4/5 Dark pub ambience, good for casual team dinners or drinks with friends. Great interiors but the lighting is not good for food photography or selfies. Food: 5/5 Must try: Chicken Death wings- ridiculously spicy will bring tears to your eyes.. Try at your Own risk. Nachos with corn n cheese were excellent. Cheese chilli garlic Naga toast was delicious. Spicy spaghetti was tasty with overload of mushrooms. Dal makhani and roti was exceptional. Drinks: 5/5 must try: Hoegaarden Draught üç∫ was too good.

"The staff was very friendly. The ambience was awesome. Just like every SOCIAL in India, my experience was totally LIT. We ordered 6 dishes. Chuza 65, loaded nachos, chicken fries, mac n cheese pasta, chilli chicken and chicken pizza. The food was yummy and the music was soothing. Moreover, they provide free wifi to post all your stories on instagram and snapchat. The place is totally worth it. Ambience:- 4/5 Food:- 4.5/5",positive
"Ambiance: 3/5 I could not figure out why the restaurant is so hyped, the restaurant setup is unrefined as they have tried to give it a more tawdry look. Its specially for the college kids as they arrange dance battles, rap battles etc. so if you are looking for a fun evening you must visit this place. Staff: 4/5 Staff is good, well mannered and they attend to their customers with a smile. Service: 4/5 The service was really quick and the servers were very Co-operative. Food: 3.5/5 Started with the Loaded Nachos. It was really loaded and served so beautifully. then we ordered Fish and chips, but I guess they do not even know how to prepare fish and chips, they just fried the fish and you could literally find oil dripping out of them, which was served with the fries. Then we ordered Crispy corn which was not at all crispy and the quantity was as if they filled the bowl with the amount one can hold in their fist. Overall: 3.5/5",positive
"On weekends, getting into social during peak lunch time can be a challenge. The joint is popular. We luckily were able to get a seat around 3 pm. The ambiance is alright, but it seemed a bit stuffy to me. Probably because of the rush, no one came to take our order for quite some time. We started with Southhall Fish and Chips, and Ghee roast chicken Bao. Bao was really good and I was tempted to have more. Fish was ok. It took a looong time to serve these items. After a brief wait, we were asked for main course orders. We went for Tandoori Soya chaamp pizza and Achari Basa. Pizza was ok, we expected it to be better. Achari basa with mashed potato was tangy and was satisfactory. We were a bit underwhelmed with the experience. We had to wait for long time for someone to take orders and then to be served. Service lacked warmth as well.",negative
"First experience was Hauz khas,New Delhi.. This is my second experience in Pune vimannagar... It was good Ambiance- 5/5 Price- 2/5 little expensive Crowd-4/5 Taste-4/5 Staff-4/5 Service-3/5",negative
"Vimannagar Social Socials is always a good idea! Be it in Mumbai or in Pune. Energy of this place has always amazed me, the food is just about right.. however some of their dishes could be a dud. Stick to ordering the usual tried and tested dishes only. They don‚Äôt compromise on the quality of alcohol in their drinks, so they score a brownie point there! The amphitheater like seating in the Vimannagar socials gives a good break from the monotonous table-chair setup. Overall, Ambience - 4.5/5 Food - 2.5/5 Drinks - 3/5 Happy eating!",negative
"A good place in Phoenix mall. Ambience is catchy. They have work place as well where you can use your laptops and work. Good service. Good music and service. Coming to food, they have very desi dishes in their menu like vadapav, pakodas, bhel etc. We orderd Nachos, chicken Tikka pizza, chiken chilli and butter chicken biryani. All of them were amazing.",positive
"Drinks:Aacharoska - Basically a Caipiroska with an Indian twist. Nice to taste. Food:Ghoda Masala Boti - Taste was nice but the mutton was a little tough.Ghee Roast Chicken - The dish was well made with a smooth texture, typically made the South Indian way with curry leaves. Aslam Butter Tikka Sizzler - The tikkas were well grilled with a slight smoky flavour laid on a bed of cabbage leaves. Butter sauce is provided separately & is poured over the tikkas as per taste. This dish is midly spiced but well flavoured. My favourite of the lot. Tandoori Momos - Your average tandoori momos. Desserts:Old Monk & Chocolate Samosa - This dessert is on their monsoon special menu & is highly recommended. Six samosas with rum infused chocolate filling One Layer Cake - This dish is layers of mousse on which hot chocolate ganache was poured. Pretty average.",positive

"Flechazo has very pretty and well maintained ambience. They have used just 2-3 colours for the walls and it makes the restaurant look pleasant. Ther service is quick and amazing. The taste is also mesmerizing. They have buffets including live counters for pizza and pasta. They also allow you to cook in their kitchen to make pizzas. It is surely a good option for vegetarian as they have lots of options in veg. The dishes are unique , well presented and tasty. Overall it is surely a good restaurant to spend time with your friends and family. They also do celebrate your birthdaysüòä",positive
"Visited flechazo about three months backs! I can't wait to go there again! Absolute joy to be here! Amazing just amazing food. Loved the starters, ambience, service, sweets!! I loved everything here! I am a fan of dumplings but sadly I couldn't get the taste in my first try but can u believe it the wonderful chef came over to our desk! And asked of we liked the food.. I told him about the dumpling, he got me one dressed in all right sauces! And voila! My day just got better. I recommend it to everybody!!!",positive
Have visited this restrau couple of times and have received good service and food. But my recent visit was poor. Chicken and paneer both were not fresh and taste was not good. Only good thing was the live couter and the dal makhni in the main course. The staff did not even served the full starters and when we asked for corn they took half an hour to bring. Not happy with the visit. The restrau is good and needs to maintain the service quality as was in the starting.,negative
"Let's keep it straight this time: - Just like another BBQ restaurant, instead there is no BBQ here, they serve you the dishes. - Liked the way they served food shots (over a conveyer belt) - The nitrogen ice cream was over hyped I believe, it sucked. - Ambience is good. - Service is good. - Over-priced. Overall food was decent, go here if you just ""wanna try a new place"" Flechazo Pune",negative
"Mind-blowing decor, first of a kind food photography destination. Tried out the Non Veg buffet. The prawns were the best of the lot, among boneless chickens, boneless fish kebabs, mutton sheek kebabs etc. There is a unique Food Shot section where you get to taste single portions of different food entities. The main course was satisfactory. The dessert section had a lot of variety. The Mango Souffle, Gulab Jamuns and Shahi Tukda were above satisfactory. The ice cream making procedure was highly engaging but the final outcome seemed to dumb down the hype. Worth a visit, in overall.",negative
"This is a buffet chain which started in Bengaluru. I must say, they are yet to replicate their brilliance in Pune. The food is amazing here. The best part is that they keep changing the menu every month. So, you always find something new whenever you visit this place. The starters, main course, everything tastes great. The dessert section is one of the best I have seen in a long time! The only thing they can improve on is handling crowd at the peak times! Its a chaos on friday/saturday nights and their staff struggles to manage it!",positive
Wow... Wat a place...So Amezing Refreshing and Food loaded place...!!! . Starters are quite amezing..

Unfortunately due to rain it was closed Indoor is as romantic as it can get Dim lights, Decent music and a view of city Food- Again one of the best I have had.. Bhatti ka Murg is really delicious starter... Murg Makhni is all time favorite Service - Pradnesh is very good.. Prompt service Price- High but worth it",positive
Combination of yummy food and dim light ambience. I love this place and will love to come again. The staff was friendly and polite. This place is good for spending Sunday night with fiends or family as it‚Äôs located in the heart of the city.,negative
Visited the place on my birthday for sometime (as already made the reservation at spice kitchen) and chose to sit on table number 450/1. The ambiance is simply amazing and fantastic. The roof top open / closed place and it's one of the Pune's best open terrace pub. The surrounding view is simply amazing and very soothing. We ordered Carlsberg and Heineken. They served some munchies as complimentary. The service is simply amazing and the staffs were very courteous and well mannered. Would like to thank Tianka & Kamlesh for serving us superbly.

This is an amazing rooftop place in Pune. The views are really good and the vibe is amazing! I loved the cocktail and the seekh kebabs were yum. Staff was friendly!,positive
Paasha :- #famishpune One of the place for those #special #moments. Cool breeze by the city View from the top. Light music and Food what else you will ask for. Tad high on pocket but worth every penny for special #occasions . üëª . . . #punecityfc #foodlo #foodlover #jwmarriott #sbroad #nightnight #nightlife #rooftop #hungergames,positive
"My 200th Review goes to this amazing place located on 24th floor of JW Marriott Ambiance - One of the best I have seen so far... Outdoor rooftop is breathtaking... Unfortunately due to rain it was closed Indoor is as romantic as it can get Dim lights, Decent music and a view of city Food- Again one of the best I have had.. Bhatti ka Murg is really delicious starter... Murg Makhni is all time favorite Service - Pradnesh is very good.. Prompt service Price- High but worth it",positive
Combination of yummy food and dim light ambience. I love this place and will love to come again. The staff was friendly and polite. This place is good for spending Sunday night with fiends or family as it‚Äôs located in the heart of the city.,negative
Visited the place on my birthday for sometime (as already made the reservation at spice kitchen) and chose to sit on table number 450/1. The ambiance is simply amazing and fantastic. The roof top open / closed place and it's one of the Pune's best open terrace pub. The surrounding view is simply amazing and very soothing. We ordered Carlsberg and Heineken. They served some munchies as complimentary. The service is simply amazing and the staffs were very courteous and well mannered. Would like to thank Tianka & Kamlesh for serving us superbly.

"Barbeque Nation at Sayaji is on the 10th floor of the building. It is a rooftop outlet with pleasant comfortable ambience and seating. The manager and the servers are quick and polite. For the nonveg starters, we had variety of chicken, mutton, prawns, fish pieces on skewers. We also had paneer and pineapple which weren't very great. One great starter was Cajun potatoes. Delicious! For the main course, we had chicken biryani, Mutton Rogan Josh, Nellori fish curry and soup. They were all good! For desert, there were a lot of different ice creams, cakes, phirni, fruits, gulab jamun, moong daal halwa, etc. The best out of these were the small round gulab jamuns. Also, we had complimentary drinks in the beginning. They ask if there's any special occasion and get a cake, which also is complimentary. The vibes are great and a good place to have a good time! Overall, recommended!",positive
I went for lunch here.The staff is very friendly and the service is upto the mark. I didn't liked the food items much.The taste was average for me. The weather was super awesome and it was drizzling so the view from the top was really awesome.,positive
"Actual rating 3.5* Went there on Friday night for team dinner. Rooftop is covered, so no feel of rooftop. Ambience is just ok, can be improved big time!! Ambience ** Food :- starters are good. Panner tikka, pineapple and crispy corn were yummy. Rest was as usual like any other place. Average main course. Desserts were nice, especially the kulfi section. The only thing you remember after walking out!! Try pista kulfi for sure. Food **** Service :- service is good not very fast but polite and soft spoken staff !! **** Cost :- *** around 800 per person !! Overall :- 3.5* with some innovation in ambience and food options, this place can become even better and a perfect family restaurant. One time visit for people staying near waked !!",negative

"We went to Barbeque nation to celebrate my brother's birthday, since it give wide variety of options. Staff were courteous, especially Amit Kumar and Raja served us right on our table. they had biryani fest going on. I loved the pizza, really cheesy. Thanks for such an amazing experience. Barbecue nation never fails our expectations.",positive
It has great ambiance with great food quality! The food is always fresh with a large variety to try ! It has separate sections for everything and is just way too much awesome,positive
This place doesn't require any marketing nor any recommendation.. It is great.. Great buffet spreads.. Amazing barbecue... Loved their pan kulfi.. Great hospitality.. Its just awsome.,positive
"Just love to be dined at BBQ nation! Always a great experience! They will serve you nicely, with a very warm and sweet smile, always come up with Great ideas and Great food! Love this place",positive
I went with my friend as we all know bbq is the best place to hangout with awesome food. As usual starter was the best fish tikka was the best prawn as well in veg fruits stick was my fav corn pineapple taste awesome. Service is always the best my friend didn't like the mutton chef prepared new mutton dish for him. I can't help myself giving 5star. Bbq just keep it up.,positive
"Love the concept, the food and the service. The starters were amazing and filling so we didn't have the main course and went straight for the desserts. I loved the tandoori chicken, lamb kebabs and chutney prawns. The fried fish was amazingly crunchy. The cajun spice potatoes and mutter palak kebabs were fab. The grilled pineapple added a new burst of flavour. There is a festival going on- The magic of mohammed ali road, so there was a live counter from which we tried the keema and naan which were good too. From the desserts we had the gulab jamun and malpua with rabdi which were nice. We ended our meal with pan kulfi which I really loved. Our server Tinku took great care of us during the entire meal. Overall it was a worthwhile experience. Will definitely visit soon :)",positive
"Coming to one of fav name,I was highly disappointed with quality of food in this outlet.. I have been to BBQ in Kolkata, Bangalore....somehow I was not satisfied this time... No issue with the franchise BBQ nations...i love your food all the time apart form this one incident...hope u check out this",negative
"Last month I went to bbq with my friend for lunch. Hospitality 10/10 ‚úî food is great ambience is pleasant . Service is quick n nice. Staff is really v polite. Food: Starter: we had 9 veg starter . Mine favorite was charcoal grilled pineapple crispy masala corn, spicy potato. All of them were really delicious. Staff even visit to take food feedback,if yu want anything spicy ,sweet, they can serve accordingly. But we didnt need because everything was upto the mark. Main course: They have 12 in mains . I had dal tadka dal makani kogta curry jeera rice and noodles is really mouth watering. I enjoyed every bite . Indian and continental deserts is a must try thing along with chocolate kulfi. My friends recommended me to try their kulfis. And also ice cream is like cherry on the cake . Yes , mango cheese cake is really good . I recommend BBQ is to my friends and family whenever they want to beat hungry.",negative
"Very nice place to BBQ with friends and family. Good food quality. Taste used to be much better earlier. Said that, it still is good. Unlimited BBQ sometimes makes you so full that you may not be able to enjoy the unlimited buffet and dessert options. I've been here many times and will continue to visit. :)",positive
"Barbeque Nation the place that has made a name for itself by virtue of the unlimited food and service it offers for a very good price. I have had an occasion to try it out when it opened near to home a couple of years ago and found it excellent. But then it sort of dropped off the radar. Though have had an opportunity to try it for team lunches/dinners in other cities. The starters were on point. Each and every BBQ stick and soups were delicious. The deserts are really good. The 6 varieties of kulfi along with the toppings was the best part of the dinner. At the end, it will leave you satisfied! Will love to visit again ‚ô•Ô∏è",positive
"We are the regular customer of this brand. This must be around 15th visit so far. Todays starters were not upto their standard, specially fish and chicken was not fresh. Desserts, main course was fantastic. Every time i give feedback to add more variety in veg food, try to add soya chaaps, chinese starters, some deep fried items as well. Overall good experience.",negative
"No place can beat the service you receive at a barbeque Nation outlet. :D The ambiance is great and the food is pretty good as well! Cajun spiced potato is one of the tastiest appetizer served here, and a must try! Coming to the main course, the spread has everything from North Indian to Chinese to Italian. Although the taste of the main course is just decent. The dessert spread is good too. The gulab Jamun here are very yummy, warm and will just melt in your mouth. Another must try is the paan kulfi. The brownies and pastries served here could be better. As kept in open it tends to get a little dry and hence not delectable. The barbeque is good and can be instructed to make according to your taste buds and liking, which in my opinion is a very good option here. Overall it is a must try!",positive
"Been meaning to visit this one from long time, decided to give this a try at last. If you love non vegetarian food and barbecue then this is the place you really want to visit. What I love about this place is the hospitality here,if you did not like even tiniest single thing about your food you can tell them freely and immediately they will make either a different dish or remake same dish just for you as you like it. My suggestion is don't go all in for just barbecue, I urge you to hold your hunger and don't only hog on BBQ and take your time first sampling each food item Go easy on BBQ, then soup then try main course items just enough that you leave some space in your stomach for the best part is dessert! The firni then some brownie and last not the least is the different kulfis here! Gosh I love their paan and chocolate kulfi with their toppings ‚ù§Ô∏è So it's best to visit the place in weekdays as often if you go there without a reservation you end up waiting for too long.",positive
"When you have meat craving visit this place. Heavenly food, Courteous staff, nice ambience. Staff takes diligently feedback and willing to customize starters based on your choice. Chef personally visits every table. This time he gave us on demand cutlet curry which was mouth watering good. We enjoy everytime we visit here. This will be always on my fav list.",positive
"Been there with team for a lunch. Going by the template of barbecue. They r best when it comes to starters and the respective taste. Its awsome. But when it goes to their maincourse buffet its just average. Its the same story accorss all the outlets i have tried, b it this one, kalyani nagar. Again on the desert section they are good, but variety is not there when u visit more than 2-3 times. Atleast that what i found after visiting barbeque outlest more than 10-15times in last 1-2 yrs. But services and all will make u feel awsome for sure.",positive
"One thing I like the most about Barbeque Nation, that is customer satisfaction. Have been couple of times at this outlet and wish to go again. Food - Always qualitative Service - awesome Ambience - awesome They have ample parking space.",positive
Brilliant service and the best starters in town. The soya chilli prawns were succulent. The unlimited meal is definitely worth it with a wonderful variety. Barbeque Nation is perfect for special occasions.,positive
Kayani Bakery is known for its Shrewsberry biscuits and mava cake. They're the best. The place is usually very crowded at peak hours and the items get sold out very quickly. The Choco Walnut Cake is good too!,positive
"I am dating this place since childhood. This happens to be one of the oldest bakery in Pune. Always loaded with customers, you have to literally fight your way to the counter. They bake some amazing stuff. Our personal favourites are The Plain Cake, Mawa Cake, Fruit Cake (Madeira Cake), Cheese Papdi, Chocolate Chip Cookies and the most famous Shrewsbury Biscuits. You can literally taste the Butter in every bite of these Shrewsbury biscuits. None of our visits have ever been complete without these goodies. This place is Legendary!",positive
"You get the smell of freshly baked products as soon as you enter the shop. The place is packed with customers buying loads of baked goods. It reminded me of varriar bakery here in Bengaluru. They have many varieties of cookies, cakes, etc. My personal favorites were Mawa cake and Shrewsberry biscuits. Totally recommend this place for some carbohydrate craving relief :)",positive
"Best quality products with reasonable price I'm love with their product specially shrewsbeery biscuit , plain cake , chocolate walnut , and mawa cake from last so many years maintained the taste and quality kudos to proprietor of this place",positive
Sheer love when I enter this place. Such yummy orange biscuits and the shrewsberry biscuits. I just buy these 2 things whenever I visit this place. Loving the orange biscuits more n more .

"I heard of this very old and legendary outlet just a few weeks back and it gave a shock to my colleagues. So one of them was kind enough to get me a cake from this bakery and I eventually tried out other products as well. This outlwt doesnt have branches so this adds to its importance. The tea cake, choco mava cake, khari, shrewberry biscuits and ginger biscuits were an absolute delight. Will visit soon for more !",positive
"Always having heard so much about Kayani bakery cakes, finally gave it a try. This place is always always just so filled with people that Only takeaways are possible. I am not a fan of mawa, and so found the mawa cakes pretty decent. But then I was introduced to the choco walnut cake by a dear friend and well I realized, this was just the perfect cake for all my sweet cravings! It's chocolate cake, a bit dry so you can't have much at a time but its got an amazing taste with pieces of walnuts inside - a must have!",positive
"This place has been there for decades and best part the taste still remains the same. Famous for shrewsbury, mawa cakes, etc. Personally dint like the ginger cookies. P.S - Have some extra time as it's always crowded.",positive

"I think barbeque ville is a leader in barbeque buffet restaurants due to prices they offer. This place have nice ambience and decor. You will see live counters including ice cream, Pastas. Starters are delicious specially chicken tangdi. But disappointed with deserts and wasn't sure if deserts were fresh. Overall a good experience.",positive
"A great buffet place. The offering is somewhat similar to Barbecue Nation, but prices are lower. Upon being seated the first thing that was served was a little platter of pani puri and dahi puri, simple stuff but quite an interesting start. The starters were great and had good variety. I was so full after the starters that I skipped the main course and just went for the live pasta station where I had pasta in white sauce. It was a simple preparation but heavenly in taste. Desserts were also good but nothing to write home about. Another interesting point about this restaurant is they don't accept any tips from diners, which is quite a new initiative.",positive
"I like places that under promise and over deliver. This restaurant gives good competition to Barbeque Nation. The location is good and bang on the main road. Ambiance is just right for group events as well cozy family outings and kitty parties. You can make reservations over the phone too. Now for the food review... starters were very similar to other barbeque restaurants... I liked their mushrooms as well the pasta from their live counter. They also offered Dahi Puri and pani puri. The main course was an okayish spread but lighter on the grease. Soup was delectable. Nan was super soft and served hot. Desserts were aplenty. Liked the phirni and chana dal halwa. There was stone ice cream, hot jalebis and hot brownies along with an assortment of other desserts such as chocolate mastani and strawberry roll. I'll visit the place again and would highly recommend it.",positive
"Nice place to hang out. Prawns and fish are recommended in starters. Good spread in main course. Recommend chicken biryani, mutton nihari in main course. Deserts are ok.. value for money.. Service is quick..staffs polite..",positive
"Initially we were a bit skeptical about going here, but we finally went. We went for lunch and were their first customers of the day. There as less options available if you compare it to ABs or BBQ Nation. But it's not about giving more it's about how good you make in whatever you have. Starters as always were nice, decent I would say. Watermelons and pineapples were little too spicy and over grilled as the watermelon didn't have any water left in itüòÅ The main course was good too. The options which they had for desserts, except rabdi jalebi nothing was up to the mark, not even the icecream (who ruins a ice cream) I would give this 3.5 stars, but the staff was good and so was the service, giving half star more. PS: If you've been to ABs and BBQ nation before, don't expect much, but if this is your first time (barbeque) go for it. Barbeque Ville",positive
Ambience and service is good but when it comes to food that matters the most this one turned out to be a disappointing experience. Starters were average and some of them seemed stale. Prawns were ok. Rest all were not seasoned and completely bland. The menu displayed was mixed up main course dishes mentioned in starters that‚Äôs a rookie mistake. Main course too was just average nothing exceptional. Biryani was better than some of the other outlets but overpowered with rose essence. Desserts were completely dry. Brownie just crumbled. Ice cream and gulab jamun saved the day for us.,negative

"We had a small friend's catch up and thus we hopped to this place with a Nearbuy coupon. The ambience is cozy with courteous staffs greeting with smile. The non veg delicacies of barbeque was really the toppers of the show. Though there was many varieties of those we liked there prawns the most. We also had paneer and pineapple to change our taste. We then moved to the main course part but we found that it could have been better. The gravy in non veg section were not up to the mark. Though the crab was good, still I would suggest that they can look out to upgrade the taste of their main course dishes. The dessert section was good with a variety of indian and oriental desserts. The ice cream was served as per the choices with a blend of accompanients. Overall it is a pocket friendly fair buffet experience for me.",negative
Place is decent. The menu is very much similar to barbeque nation. The taste it has maintained is good. Chicken tangdi was awesome in starters and so the prawns. Crabs in main course was delicious. Gulab jamuns were very fresh.,positive
"I went here with my Family friends. What I didn‚Äôt like:- 1. Lack of Variety ins starters , served following( Mushroom , Pineapple , Paneer , Corn , Dhokla ) 2. Main course was cold except Roti and Paneer 3. 90% of the main course items were Gujarati except paneer . Had main course with only paneer. The only best thing I had was good time with friends. Quality :2/5 Value for money :2/5 No mocktails were part of the meal.",negative
One of the finest barbeques. Loved the ambience and the variety of food options. Loved their dessert and starters. Staff are also good and polite. Hospitality is üëç.,positive
"We recently went to this place on a team lunch. I have been to their outlet in Chinchwad and it is much better than this one. The service was okay, but the food was not really upto the mark. I know people dont focus much on main course at places like these, but that shouldn't mean that the standard of food should go down so much. If you are too bored of barbeque places serving the same thing, you should definitely try this place, preferable the Chinchwad outlet, they tend to bring some variation in the menu as compared to other zillions of buffet places.",negative
"Had brunch at @bbqville.pune today . Firstly the place was so jam-packed at 12.30, luckily there was one seat left which we occupied, moment later servers started coming in with barbecued prawns, fish, chicken, mutton, mushrooms, pineapple and lot more stuff... everything had a distinct taste and was nicely cooked, till the time we could reach main course we were already full, in main course chicken Biryani was very nice, some curries were nice too, though noodles, soup and pasta was not at all upto the mark...ended our lunch with sweets which I would say was okayish...nothing great I can mention in that apart from brownies . All in all a good experience for 1400 rupees all inclusive . While coming down we saw atleast 30 people waiting for their turn ...if you are visiting be the early bird there My rating 4/5",positive
"Place is best to have barbeque in Wakad and adjacent area. They have a plenty of seating area easy to accommodate a large team. For veg they had 7 types of starters mainly panner, mushroom, pineapple, sparkling corn etc. For main course they had one panner dish, mix veg, dal makhni, normal dal, plain rice, pulav along with soup and 6 types of salad. They had 8 different types of desserts including brownie, gulab jamun, phirni etc. Service is quite good and decent, we were served mainly by Tushar who was quick on everything we needed. Just a negative is the wait time, we waited for 1 hr to have a seat , but apart from that rest everything is good. Update:- rates are fixed to 629 fir Sunday lunch... As per date 13th Oct 2019",positive
"We visited this place yesterday on Friday good place, good food quality and service nice ambiance little disappointing with service because service was slow otherwise good food quality as we accepted",positive
"Had my birthday dinner here and tasted dumplings and biryani. Water chestnuts dumplings: The covering of dumplings could have been more thin, dumplings did not have a blast of flavours but it was tasty and complex once you dipped it in the sauces provided. Chicken Tikka Biryani: Came in a mini pressure cooker, served with salan and raita. Salan could have been more flavoursome. Chicken pieces were tender and the flavour of rice was really good. The prices are a bit on higher side but the quantity and taste of food justifies it.

Fancy place that‚Äôs what First comes to your mind when you enter this restaurant. The food is tasty you will love it. They have twisted the menu a bit and made it fusion this was the 2nd time I visited and there is difference in menu. The ambience is wonderful and the place is very huge.

Cult is the perfect place to be when around magarpatta ! This part of the city really needs some new places to hangout at and cult does justice. The place has a huge searing capacity and is done up beautifully with minimalistic decor. Here's what I had- ‚Ä¢Peri peri chicken- loved this starter perfect to have with cocktails. #highlyrecommend ‚Ä¢Desi Chilli Paneer- the paneer was really soft although it was paneer chilly it wasn't spicy but worked for me. ‚Ä¢Dal makhani - this was so delicious! You have to try this .#recommend ‚Ä¢Veg pizza- with the correct amount of toppings and cheese this was one of my favourites here. #highlyrecommend ‚Ä¢Chocolate Brownie with ice cream- the brownie here was sinful and made it the perfect dessert to end my meal. #highlyrecommend Apart from this also had their chicken starter and gravy but the chicken was a but chewy and the gravy was wasn't great! Also had the tiramisu which wasn't strong and was quite average.,positive
Went for a Sunday Brunch. What a great vibe. Loved the music and the ambience. Had some amazing moonshine coffee mead. Some sushi. Some kebabs. Some nachos. Mains. Shrimp cocktail. desserts. Nothing was disappointing. Overall loved this place the vibe the ambience the decor. Mesmerizing.,positive
"I loved the ambience, the food is good too... The music was n the background was sober so was good for a family dinner. The service was way to slow, u went there with my team, and had to wait 30-40 mins after placing an order. Overall a decent place...

"Had my birthday dinner here and tasted dumplings and biryani.

"This place has great ambience, great food and great taste! It might be a bit too spicy or peppery for some people liking but in all it's a great place to go with family, friend and even office colleagues. A great place in all.

"Ordered kaju biriyani. Packing - Good. Flavor - Good. Texture - Rice was mushy and kinda like a paste. Too less quantity of raita. After a spicy rice course, anyone wants some relief. Some more raita would have been better. üòí",negative
We wanted to revisit our Hinjewadi lunch days and this was the best place to do so. We ordered our all time favourite aromas Hyderabadi chicken biryani boneless and Kaju Biryani. Alongwith it we ordered chicken roganjosh and naan. Curry was spicy and very tasty and went well with naan. Biryani like always was delicious and we enjoyed it. Service was good and ambience was also good. Overall nice experience and must visit place! Food: 4/5 Service: 4/5 Ambience: 4/5 Value for Money: 4/5,positive
I have just tried their Spicy chicken Tandoori leg and it was just mouth watering. It serves as a perfect starter for people craving for some spicy delicacy. Will definitely try other items on their menu and update accordingly.,positive
Ordered Biryani from this place while I was in Pune. This place legit serves the best Biryani in Pune. The quantity is sufficient for two people. The taste is amazing and the aroma is drool-worthy. They serve biryani along with gravy and salad. The biryani is mildly spicy but oh so full of flavour. Do try this place out if you haven't already.,positive
"Visited the place today for lunch and sat on table number F4. The ambiance is very soothing and rich. We ordered one non-veg Shorba, one Apollo fish, one mutton biryani and sweet lime soda. The Shorba was great in taste. The Apollo fish was very soft and very well cooked. Last but not the least the mutton biryani was delicious in taste and very well cooked and it was less spicy as well. One of the unique thing that I liked the most is their finger bowl with rose petals in it. The service was prompt and the staffs were courteous. Thanks to Mr. Rehman for attending us.

"The ambience was really good. The biryani was okay-ish. The taste was good but the veggies were cut into really big pieces. The raita which comes w it was amazing, too good. The paneer tikka was not that great, okay-ish.",negative
"Good Food, Fresh Ambience, Great Service by Captain Sajit. We had ""Aroma's special mutton biryani"" and ""Mutton dum biryani"". Aroma's special mutton biryani was really good. Ask for double masala biryani if you would like to be spicier. Quantity seems to be a bit less for the price. We had ""Shahi Tukda"" in dessert and it was really good as well. Bread wasn't crunchy though. Overall a good experience.",positive

"Aroma Special Biryani is just amazing. Had a bad experience last time, but this one was out of the box. Ordered it on my friends suggestion, but no regrets. Indeed the aroma and taste was pleasing. A bit spicy though, there should be a choice to choose spicy level during online ordering.",positive
"I would give this place 0 star if it was possible. I‚Äôve always visited their Pimple Saudagar and Warje outlets. The taste of biryani is so good when you visit and eat. However, I was too tired to head out today and found this outlet on UberEats. Ordered the Chicken Biryani Jumbo worth 719 rupees for three. I regret spending that amount now. The biryani was completely tasteless- oh wait! There was only ONE taste- Extremely Spicy! And nothing else... My dad fell a bit sick after consuming it. Eating it felt like chewing and gulping chilly powder mixed with plain rice. I would never recommend anyone to order anything from this outlet. I guess they cheat customers by providing them remnants if you order online. Because the taste is completely different when we actually go to eat in the outlets. Pathetic!",negative
The best biriyani I ever had in Pune. It gave me the taste of Hyderabad House in Mysore. Though you will find biriyani in all restaurants but the taste it has is unique. You might not enjoy the ambience but you will definitely love the food. I liked the chicken punjabi as it had tandoori pieces in it. Andra Mutton was awesome but it was bit spicy. Kebabs were also good in taste. Quantity of all the items were excellent. If you are a biriyani and mutton lover then you should visit this place once.,positive
This place is a good option mainly because of the quantity they provide. They offer half and full portion of almost all the dishes. The half portion is enough for two people who are not insanely hungry. The dish i ordered was Fried chicken Wings (half). The batter they use to make the chinese dishes are the same regardless of it being anything. I may go back here because of the prices and quantity but they can better the taste of the dishes alot.,negative
"The best biryani I had after a long time that too in Pune. It's situated at warje just besides shell petrol pump. We went here for a lunch and had ordered the following:- Chicken Angara Kebab: Must try, it was well made chicken was good and it was quite spicy as per our expectation. Aromas Special Chicken Biryani boneless: I would say this was simple wonderful. We went for regular and it serves us for 2. Good taste, masala was also great and I would say it's a must try.

"Review no :226 Ordered Aroma‚Äôs chicken biryani & Reshmi kabab for a dinner to complement some interesting home food prepared. I must this place has got one of nice packing in which we received hot food. Biryani is one of best I had in many days. Very flavourful, chicken was moist & very well cooked. Relished the food every bit of it. Reshmi kabab was well marinated, well cooked in tandoor. Again excellent taste & both dishes complemented to our home food. Biryani is Must try ! VFM :5/5 Taste :5/5 Service :5/5 Hygiene:5/5 Overall :5/5",positive
This hotel has a good ambience also the food quality is one of the best. Here is the best biryani I have ever had. The taste and aroma as per name is amazing. The price is worth and the quantity is also perfect for price.,positive
This has been my new favourite place to go whenever I want to experience just tasty food without fringes. Whatever you order you can be rest assured that it taste really good. Aroma's special Biryanis are awesome and chicken chatpata is heavenly.,positive
One of the best place in pune with great ambience and finger licking tasty food! *PLANET 9 Bistro* Place has a three theme of seating arrangement 1. Dining in water theme 2.

"Visited this place few days back Loved the royal Ambiance with different sitting arrangement. (Top floor, water and ground) Loved the concept of sitting in the water (not literally sitting in the water) Food was amazing, tried some of the chefs special dishes.",positive
"Sand & water theme tables is very interesting concept. Quantity is good & so is the taste. We ordered Cesar salad, paneer chilly, pasta & red thai curry. Despite being Punjabi-mughlai restaurant this different cuisine dishes were good too. Cesar salad was very average, just full of iceberg lettuce only. They had option of red or white pasta, on our request they got mix sauce pasta for us. Service was very promt , staff was attentive & food was hot. Quality seems nice. Red thai curry was with rice in good quantity again. Music was little loud. Good place to hangout with friends & even for families esp. kids enjoy sand,water & dancing. But there is no separate Smoking zone so its not good for kids also. Overall food 4/5 quantity 5/5 ambience 4/5 Important- They don't serve drinking water, you have to buy packaged drinking water bottles which they charge 40rs which is twice the price ! Every place that serves food should have drinking water facility.",positive

In fact enough to say that it is worth driving here from Mumbai for a meal. We very likely may do it again. üòäüëåüèº",positive
"I had been to this place many times before and they are just amazing. Every time I try new things here, I would recommend expresso pannacotta, macaroons, crepes, 3 cheese pasta. This time I tried french toast. Maple syrup should be a little more in quantity. The only thing I felt bad this time was macaroons were over-sweetened expect dark chocolate. New flavors like lemon thyme and paan are also good. and also.. didn't try this time but der blue berry cheese cake was not looking good.. previously it used to be fluppy or may be white layer of cheese used be more",positive

So I am talking about Le Plaisir, it's a casual dining with a great menu, we tried the following: Cheese Garlic Bread - An amazing cheesy bread with right amount of garlic and herbs, it was really tasty, we had this with refreshing Peach ice tea. Parmesan Cream Pasta - We got this made in penne pasta with loads of assorted veggies, simply loved this creamy pasta dish.

"So as we all are blessed to have Oktoberfest we headed over to one of the best breweries in Pune. In drinks we tried the Oktober Lager which is exclusive for this month and their most popular brew the Belgian ale. Since it's Navaratri we had to focus on veg food in which we tried 1. The Toit full house pizza - A fully veggies loaded pizza 2. BBQ Madras Mushroom - You get a perfect taste of BBQ sauce in it . 3. Aglio Olio - It's a Spaghetti pasta but if you expect a tangy flavoured pasta , this dish is not meant for you. 4. Potato wedges - As the fries were not available we tried these instead the mayonnaise served along with the wedges is delicious. Ambience - 5/5 Music - 3/5 since it was too low. Food - 5/5 Beer - 5/5 Follow @ab_kya_khauu on instagram for more such posts",positive
Highly recommend this place to all. The crowd and music were awesome. Food is delicious and service is good. Ambience is great. Food ordered - 1. Toit full house pizza - The pizza size was large and the taste was good. Can be better. 2. Potato Wedges - these were delicious and yummy. 3. Chilli Cheese Bhajji - The chillies filled with cheese and coated with besan.. This was something different to the normal Bhajji. Follow me @fo0die_vibes on Instagram for more such places.,positive
"For the love of beers, this place is a treasure of crafted beers. The ambience is wonderful and location is peaceful as bliss right at Kalyaninagar. Try Belgian Wheat ale with Chicken Screwers or some steak. Mild music will add to your mood as well. Definitely the place is much better and won't pinch your pocket much.

"Toit is one of those amazing places that serves the best brewed beer and even better food. Everything about this place is top notch. The ambiance, the rustic yet modern decor, the music, everything!!!! Even though this place is huge, it‚Äôs still always cramped and unexpectedly crowded. Well the quality Toit tends to serves has everyone flocking even though they have no offers at all. If you haven‚Äôt been here as yet, it should be at the top of ur list.",positive
"Been here more than 4-5 times now, mostly on weekends. What everyone here does is that they book a table and then have drinks in the common hangout area. It's pretty cool, there's good music, its almost always very lively and bustling, amazing crowd. Had the pizza and the nachos,over both of'em. Beers; if you don't like the very bitter ones, go for Tintin toit or toit weiss; if you do then colonial toit and dark knight are good options. Then there's apple cider which is sweet, but I personally don't like it that much at toit.",positive
"Awesome place for some good food and drinks! Potato wedges, pizza and the brewed beer is just the best for you to spend a perfect evening! This place is located in one of the prime locations of Pune and has a lovely ambience. The staff is friendly and would recommend you with some great options they offer!

"One of the best food hunts in Pune. From starters to mocktails to exciting continental and middle Eastern course and nevertheless. This joint has got lots of surprises on the cards to relish your taste buds. Each and every dish is delicious. Their hospitality and ambience is beyond mention. Very very satisfying experience. Tried... Veg and non veg soup. Lemon chicken, Hallem samosa, Baby corn Cheese starter Polighoray Pizza, Telangana Mutton and pasta",positive
"Wonderful place. Good beers, good food, good music and to top it all good staff. Cant get any better. Tried the german lager during Oktoberfest, good beer with some decent pretzel to go along. Must try!!!",positive
"So as we all are blessed to have Oktoberfest we headed over to one of the best breweries in Pune. In drinks we tried the Oktober Lager which is exclusive for this month and their most popular brew the Belgian ale. Since it's Navaratri we had to focus on veg food in which we tried 1. The Toit full house pizza - A fully veggies loaded pizza 2. BBQ Madras Mushroom - You get a perfect taste of BBQ sauce in it . 3. Aglio Olio - It's a Spaghetti pasta but if you expect a tangy flavoured pasta , this dish is not meant for you. 4. Potato wedges - As the fries were not available we tried these instead the mayonnaise served along with the wedges is delicious. Ambience - 5/5 Music - 3/5 since it was too low. Food - 5/5 Beer - 5/5 Follow @ab_kya_khauu on instagram for more such posts",positive
Highly recommend this place to all. The crowd and music were awesome. Food is delicious and service is good. Ambience is great. Food ordered - 1. Toit full house pizza - The pizza size was large and the taste was good. Can be better. 2. Potato Wedges - these were delicious and yummy. 3. Chilli Cheese Bhajji - The chillies filled with cheese and coated with besan.. This was something different to the normal Bhajji. Follow me @fo0die_vibes on Instagram for more such places.,positive
"For the love of beers, this place is a treasure of crafted beers. The ambience is wonderful and location is peaceful as bliss right at Kalyaninagar. Try Belgian Wheat ale with Chicken Screwers or some steak. Mild music will add to your mood as well. Definitely the place is much better and won't pinch your pocket much. Overall I would definitely recommend for a visit.",positive

I often visit 1bhk but was really eagar to try this new bigger place and was really delightful to be here. The Mills is really a good getaway place from the otherwise crowded streets of the city and this big bro of 1bhk is a must visit. We ordered the chkn teriyaki & chkn shish tawook with humus & pita bread (kuboos) and was not surprised with quality of food. Simply delicious. Teriyaki comes loaded with side veggies & humus here is one of the best in town. At first the service was neglected but the manager Ajit & our captain Jaydeep ready made sure we had a good experience in the end üëçüèª,positive

Lunch was at 2BHK DINER At the mills. Unusual name but ordered their famous salli boti for starters. Very tasty but was also very spicy and quite a few pieces had fat on them. This was followed by their smoked chicken. They were basically drum sticks. Good in taste and came with a nice sauce. Dessert was tiramisu which was decent. Service was nice and ambience was great. Music was fantastic.,positive

The waiter was purely useless.We ordered a mushroom galouti kebab which was like a paste (literally paste) now cumon i know what galouti kebabs are not having it for first time.But upon asking the waiter to take it back he was like no can't return it u have it.Dude this is not some prison i dont like something i will return it.Now luckily a a captian noticed this and came to our table and offered a replacement for the dish.Guys please train your waiters .You definitely can't force a customer eat something if he doesn't like it.

"Little overpriced but considering quantity it's worth. It's mandatory to pay 10% service charge which should be optional and they are asking it upfront that our policy is to charge 10% and if you don't want to pay please leave. Staff is sort of rude, they will make sure you avoid ordering indian beers. Sitting arrangement is too complicated, it feels more like sophisticated version of Vaishali or Rupali. Overall food is good, fish and chips are Crispy and they use RAVAS for the same. Palak nalli gosht would be my pick of the menu. Seas food chowder was way to watery and tends to be Salty, nothing bad but creamy, thick chowder feels more like a chowder.",positive

"#dinnertimesbelike #jabbhookhlagtihai #insearchoffood #customerreview After attending a party we friends were yearning to have something different...we did think of a lot of options but we did know that @1bhk is close by. It was Halloween night that day and we entered in this spooky looking restaurant. The waiters too were in same theme with amazing fave painting done and red horns on their head. With drinks we ordered for only Biryani...baby bhookh lagi thi. It took time to come but worth it. Awesome quantity, so many chkn pieces and then the kaju on top in generous quantity stole my heart. We didn't order anything else and enjoyed it to the last bite. So the next time u all go to 1bhk, air kahin jao ya na jao...do visit this place for awesome hospitality and food. Dont miss the Biryani... Chicken Biryani Taste - Delicious Quantity - 2 hungry bellies can finish it Cost - within 350. Cant recollect shadesofexpressions.wordpress.com",positive

"Awesome place to go for chicken lovers. All the dishes that we ordered were mind blowing. Chicken naaza, chicken seekh kabab, Chinese stir fried chicken, Lasagna, prawns, tiramisu and much more. Finally got a place which serves good blue berry cheesecake.",positive
"Visited the restaurant last Saturday. I selected the restaurant based on the ratings on the zomato however, the food quality and overall experience wasn't quite up to the mark. The Cheesy nachos lacked the designated makings of the pub food. The chicken wings were partially raw from the inside so we had to send it back. I am giving it a three star rating because I liked the way the restaurant looked, it's beautifully designed . The brownie milk shake was quite a tasty affair. Speaking of the staff, they definitely need training on professional behavior. I won't comment further on it because they definitely made me feel uncomfortable. Overall experience would be to not come back and definitely not recommend the restaurant to any other person.",negative
On a Saturday evening with a mad rush every where in pune we booked a table and was very happy to get a place. On the first impression was a posh decorated restaurant and as we made ourselves up the stairs to find a pretty well placed bar and nicely spacious tables and chairs. The location is prime. The food was great.. üëå Service was the best.. ‚úåÔ∏è The bartenders did a fantastic job on the fire shots.. üî•üëè Definitely a revisit. Good luck and keep it up.. üëç Highly recommend.,positive
"The name sounds like real-estate jargon, but you won't find landlords asking not to play loud music at nights or 'no boys'/ 'no girls' restriction. üòÑ Music plays till closing time and you're obviously welcome with your opposite gender friends. But let's not digress, this restaurant is surprisingly good. We ordered Chicken wings, Nachos, Carbonara, and drinks. Food was pleasantly delicious. The salsa with the Nachos was amazing! Chicken wings were 4.5/5, could have been slightly more cooked. Maybe 1 min more. But I'm not complaining. It wasn't undercooked. But I'm being picky here now. Nachos were great. Recommended. 5/5 üëåüèª I've had better carbonara elsewhere, but nevertheless, this wasn't bad at all. Maybe 8.5/10 Drinks were above avg too. Ambiance is cool. DJ was playing cool songs. People enjoyed the set. Overall, if you're looking for a place to have a good evening with friends, I would recommend it.",positive
Ambience is good. Food is delicious. Quantity is satisfying for two. All in all it‚Äôs good. A Must visit. A little expensive but with Zomato gold it‚Äôs flexible.,positive
"Amazing place to start with. I loved the decor of the place. We were 6 people and had a great time. There are 2 floors. The one on top is where all the fun is at. They have good food, good ambience, not very heavy on the pocket too. We went with zomato gold so it was pretty sorted for us. Would love to go back",positive
Super duper place and it makes you come back again and again. The Fridays here are specifically awesome but so are the other days. The food is super yummy and you will find ample of varieties in the menu to try a new one every time. The staff is very friendly.,positive
"Awesome place to hang out with friends .. Good variety of platters ( lebanese, morocon, Indian , Italian)and cocktails ..Service was also good and prompt .. we tried non-veg platter fusion which included sea food , chicken ,fish mutton with four different sauces .. It was too yummy also I tried a cocktail -Blood on the dance floor which was also very good .. Bit expensive but overall experience was good ..",positive
"The ambience is fantastic, it's such a huge place, almost never ending...good decor, very outsidy and bright, lots of green around. The bar menu is a bit stunted. I have one complaint though, the service is very poor, the cutlery was dirty, I had to remind the server everything twice and it's as if they will not come to you unless called. No managers supervising them. Besides that one complaint, I had a great time. I will give this place another try and see if this aspect has improved. All the best :)",positive
"Had been to this place with a friend on Sunday noon for lunch. Loved the ambience, it was also decked up for the Halloween! It‚Äôs a big area and hence the loads of open seating covered with good green plants. We ordered couple of beers (brewery hasn‚Äôt started yet) Chilli Gobi and Egg curry with rice. The chilli gobi was crispy but needed more flavor to it, the egg curry was top notch, done in Malabar style with coconut milk! The staff responded well and the service was quick. Overall a fantastic place with good food, open air ambience and fine music.",positive
"This place was on my list for a really long time and I finally decided to head here on a Sunday afternoon. Uru brewpark is situated near Vega city mall and is easy to locate. The interiors are really well done and is a huge place which can easily fit 100+ people. Now coming to the food we had ‚Ä¢Chicken Wings was so goood, meat fell off the bone. ‚Ä¢Chili Chicken was good. ‚Ä¢Chili Paneer was delicious. ‚Ä¢Crispy Corn was great. ‚Ä¢Four cheese pizza was easily one of the best I've had. ‚Ä¢Veg spring roll was delicious. We had a couple of mocktails,all of them were good but this drink called HOT LADY stood out. Staff is really friendly and warm but service is pretty bad.Since it's a pretty big place they lag a little in service.",positive
Visited Uru for the Sunday brunch. The food-only brunch is 1128 all inclusive and is a good deal overall. The place is spread over a large stretch of land and the open spaces ensure that families with kids can have a good time here. The brunch is good with the pizza and dahi bhalla finding a special mention. Worth a visit on a lazy Sunday afternoon.,positive
"This place is never ending, really huge with so many seating arrangements. Totally scored on the ambience part but not so much on the food. Ordered for Herb Crusted Chicken nuggets, a certain chicken bowl/salad and Naan with Kerala style chicken curry for main at the end. Of all of these, the salad was the best but that too was problematic at the start coz they served it to us without the chicken in it! The rest of the dishes taste wise weren't so impressive, portions were disappointing too.",negative
Wow...wow..woww...amidst all the hustle of bannerghata road this awsome place is just opposite of vega city mall....the beautiful place with a large openn space with a beautiful garden. Anybody who loves to be in nature will love this place but the food lovers ll also love this place because the food is tasty and its just what u need to be in such a place...where you can chill with a beer. Or have a family lunch dinner...or a nice stroll around the garden with some awsome clicks or a party. Lets come to the service....everybody is there to take carr of u. We had BAPAN....who was very helpful and helped us with choosing a good pick on the menu. Thanku BAPAN and Thanku URU ....we have had one of the best lunch and fun.,positive
"WHEN will you guys speed up ur service? It wasn‚Äôt even too crowded yest, yet, so SLOW! They forgot many of our orders and then there was a service charge of 900 bucks. For what? Not a BREW park yet! The place is absolutely nice with the park feels and the Pizzas were great too, but, it took forever to get drinks n food and then after 20 mins, u guys realise the order wasn‚Äôt passed to the bar n kitchen.

Went for a dinnner date over a weekday. The ambience is welcoming. The ambience is well lit and spacious. They have an eloborate menu with lot of options. Starters: Other than grills we have wish grill and other starters table served. And everything is great and customized to taste. Main course: Wide varieties of main course. Tasted a few and it was great. Desserts: there are 4 live counters for deserters and it is great. Overall a great experience. Asim & Susanth served us. And the service was warm and great!,positive
"Located in the prime location of Marathahali , the big barbeque has become one of the favourite places for corporate lunch and dinner! Serving more than 180 items in buffet , this place has variety of options for everyone. Loved the ambience as the place is huge and has sufficient seating arrangements done. The staff is friendly and they have planned many entertainments which they perform frequently every hour. I recommend to give this place a try if you are looking for buffet options.",positive

"Went to this huge really huge place. i think so it is one of the biggest barbecue place in Bangalore. i could see a huge lobby when i entered the place and was very much surprised with the village theme. After crossing the lobby we entered the dining area which was really beautiful and again very huge. i guess they can actually accommodate 200+ ppl at one go. Talking about the food they have lots and lots of options compared to other barbecue places. good enough counters for sweets, pizza , live grill , pasta and bar. i loved many things in food. The items they serve in th bbq in veg and nonveg both were really delicious. i loved the real soft fish and prawns which had a charred flavour. on the love grill i liked octopus and squid. they served us with chuski in between which was served in a miniature cooker which was super cute. overall i had a great experience. would recommend you guys to give it a try once hope you love it.",positive
"Woww this place has now come near to my office, the best place to go for your office outing or team lunch or even for a family dinner. This is the best place so far i liked for barbecue they have huge varieties of food ranging from different live counters to dessert. Some nice points: 1. nice waiting area. 2. separate smoking room 3. huge place with lots of ventilation 4. great dance by the staff 5. live chat counters and grills which are amazing. 6. live jalebi and pizza too. 7. welcome drink was amazing. what i would like to give suggestion is have paneer specially for veg in barbecue, some people don't eat mushroom they have more mushrooms in barbecue. A must visit place. Ambiance: 5/5 food: 4.5/5 service: 4.5/5 foodtravelpedia.wordpress.com",positive
"When you get inside, u will be overwhelmed by the number of options u have. The place is very beautiful with the lights etc. What they have different from the other barbeque places is that they have a private space/dance floor right in the middle which can be used for hosting birthdays. The waiters are trained to dance for the birthday celebrations too. They also serve ice gola in a cute little cooker. What you can expect is a great BBQ spread and a fun time.",positive
"As the name suggests this place is huge, with lots of sitting option, great hospitality and delicious food this place is surely going to win your heart. They offer a lot of varities for both vegetarian and non-vegetarian. For starters we tried Pani Puri and Raj Kachori both were excellent. Then we tried Vegetarian and Non-Vegetarian Pizza both were good. Moving on to main course we tried Chicken fried rice , Egg Kurchen, Sarso Crab and Murgh Makhani, all the dishes were brilliantly made. Coming to desserts, they have a huge section for it, amongst those the ones which I found exclusive were Malai Kulfi, Kala Khatta Gola and Semiya Kheer. They also offer something which i had never tried before it's a Paan Shot, and to be honest it was very refreshing. They also have a really nice way to celebrate birthdays, what they do is people who serve there they perform to the song of your choice and wish you a very happy birthday. Overall, its a lovely and a must visit place.",positive

The items they serve in th bbq in veg and nonveg both were really delicious. i loved the real soft fish and prawns which had a charred flavour. on the love grill i liked octopus and squid. they served us with chuski in between which was served in a miniature cooker which was super cute. overall i had a great experience. would recommend you guys to give it a try once hope you love it.",positive
"Woww this place has now come near to my office, the best place to go for your office outing or team lunch or even for a family dinner. This is the best place so far i liked for barbecue they have huge varieties of food ranging from different live counters to dessert. Some nice points: 1. nice waiting area. 2. separate smoking room 3. huge place with lots of ventilation 4. great dance by the staff 5. live chat counters and grills which are amazing. 6. live jalebi and pizza too. 7. welcome drink was amazing. what i would like to give suggestion is have paneer specially for veg in barbecue, some people don't eat mushroom they have more mushrooms in barbecue. A must visit place. Ambiance: 5/5 food: 4.5/5 service: 4.5/5 foodtravelpedia.wordpress.com",positive
"When you get inside, u will be overwhelmed by the number of options u have. The place is very beautiful with the lights etc. What they have different from the other barbeque places is that they have a private space/dance floor right in the middle which can be used for hosting birthdays. The waiters are trained to dance for the birthday celebrations too. They also serve ice gola in a cute little cooker. What you can expect is a great BBQ spread and a fun time.",positive
"As the name suggests this place is huge, with lots of sitting option, great hospitality and delicious food this place is surely going to win your heart. They offer a lot of varities for both vegetarian and non-vegetarian. For starters we tried Pani Puri and Raj Kachori both were excellent. Then we tried Vegetarian and Non-Vegetarian Pizza both were good. Moving on to main course we tried Chicken fried rice , Egg Kurchen, Sarso Crab and Murgh Makhani, all the dishes were brilliantly made. Coming to desserts, they have a huge section for it, amongst those the ones which I found exclusive were Malai Kulfi, Kala Khatta Gola and Semiya Kheer. They also offer something which i had never tried before it's a Paan Shot, and to be honest it was very refreshing. They also have a really nice way to celebrate birthdays, what they do is people who serve there they perform to the song of your choice and wish you a very happy birthday. Overall, its a lovely and a must visit place.",positive
Came for lunch.Varities are very less. They brought all burned grilled items told to remove they replaced with fresh items. Starters and main coarse was tasty. Special grill was hopeless. Seafood grill was stinking it was not fresh. Ram babu was good in serving the food.,negative
"So, been here today and the place was packed ...inspite of booking, had to wait for 10 min. It‚Äôs same like barbecue nation. Mr. Naseerull served us, very friendly person and he provided us very good service. Food is same with starters of chicken mutton fish prawns n some vegis ..live counter with specialties of duck turkey octopus etc..dessert counter is nice but taste is average. Overall a good experience.. loved the fish gravy with fried rice.",positive
On the occasion of wifey's birthday we had visited here ! First of all we say the zomato rating which made us to come here. But then it is worth all the rating..truly ! The best thing which I felt was the courteous staff here and to mention Jahangir helped us through our meals and gave very good suggestions! Thanks for that. Ambience- 4/5 Food -4.5/5 Hospitality- 5/5 Service - 5/5 Pocket friendly- 4.5/5 Note : The best thing to crave here are the Veg starters. Too good !,positive
Based on zomato reviews & ratings visited this place for team lunch. We opted for veg buffet and below review is based on same. Variety of starters were there and they were quite tasty as well. However main coarse only had few options and we tried only few items. Desserts were quite tasty and we really loved them. Service was really nice and staff was quite active on floor. Overall worth trying if looking for buffet in EC area.,positive
Loved the place and food too. Lot of options in the buffet. Service is very quick and dedicated specially by jahangir sir. Very good place for foodie. Will look forward to some surprise food menu for the next time.,positive
"Came here for lunch today. Loved the starters. All of them were perfectly made with the perfect amount of spices. Look out for the awesome dishes in the main course. Nati chicken and crab goan curry were awesome. There were a lot of items in the live counter starting with rabbit, octopus, duck, prawns, squid and fishes. Jahangir helped us with the starters and had shown great hospitality. Had a chat with him and came to know he is from Murshidabad. You can personally ask for him if you want to have a great experience here. Would love to visit again. Looking forward to some more great dishes next time.",positive
It's an lovely experience to be in this new buffet restaurant. I came here by seeing the Zomato review only. And the food and service was just great. Jahangir was the name of the waiter who was serving us. He is very polite and the service ambiance everything we just loved.,positive
"So happened to come here on a weekday. Amazing hospitality by the staff. Special mention for Koushik who throughout the time assisted me and my friend. He made sure that our first visit and my friends birthday went smooth with a rich and pleasant experience. Ambience and food 10/10 for sure, special mention being the salsa potato, veg kebab and desserts. We also ordered Virgin Margherita which was too good. Well lit area and latest songs. Thanks to Big Barbeque and staff for celebrating my friends birthday, singing him a song and of course the cake. Keep up the good work and I hope to visit it again.",positive
"Few days back, on my friend farewell we have gone to this newly opened restaurant ‚Äúthe big barbeque‚Äù. Even through the place is small but can handle larger group is people. Usually being a foodie I like to take every thing, but unfortunately I did not like the main course( non veg) and the live sweet section . The live food and the bbq starters were great and taste. But the best part is the service of the waiters there are always around you to get a great experience.",negative
"Had a wonderful time at AB‚Äôs with a small cake mixing event post which, I binged on their buffet for the second time. Let me tell u this, I stopped BBQ nation long back coz they din have the VARIETY back then (not sure now), but these guys have some great stuff at the live counter which I was super excited about. To begin, they have the BEST STAFF I have come across in these 30 years. No friggin jokes. The live counter was awesome and the starters too. Din have the space to belt main course so jus had roti n some very standard/average non veg gravy which is expected at places where they serve buffet. The desserts were many so had a tough time to choose from in order to control to sugar intake, however, couldn‚Äôt resist the mini Gulab Jamuns üî• It was awesome. Thanks to Zayed, Javed and all the staff for an amazing time. Catch highlights on my Instagram page: @bangalorefoodboy89",positive
"Great starters , average dessert , but main course was not impressive. You wouldn't care much about the main course anyway though. Dessert selection could be better.",positive
This place remains very crowded. The place is full of energy. Staff is super friendly and warm. They had a large option of starters and main course and really exotic ones. They serve starters on the table and main course and desserts are spread in buffer. Overall a good experience. I had a great evening.,positive
"If you are looking out for buffet AB's is ideal choice. This place is always packed better book online and go. The do provide good barbecue'd veg and non veg.I liked Desserts more than anything,Among the barbecued I liked jamun it was first time I had barbecued jamun it was really good! Service is also good ! Staff are also amazing! Ambience they could hv improved! They do give birthday cake and play Music This place highly recommend for team/family's lunch or dinner Overall Food -4/5 Ambience-3/5 Service-5/5",positive
"Would I Recommend ‚û°Ô∏è No Ambiance Very congested and gets pretty warm once the table grills are on. A few of the alcohol on menu not available at the bar. Firstly the options are less and it's a disappointment to Not have them. Food The grills that were served on table were either very bland or over cooked, hard and chewy. So most of the grills on table were repeated heated/cooked before it comes to table as a result the chicken very chewy and the prawns very stiff. The Veg grills were not good either. The Paneer hardly had a marination to it. We asked for chicken chilly and what came to table was a disaster. I request the management to focus on the concept what ABs is popular for. As a audience we demand quality food and not quantity merely. The cocktails and mocktail were overly sweetened too. Which again was very poor to see here. Main course gravies were pretty decent and the Biryani overly bland. So in all it was a poor experience. #notrecommended",negative
"Went to AB's for team lunch. This place offers a lot of varieties when it comes to food. The starters were good but were too bland and the complementary drinks were good too. The live counters had momos, noodles, paani puri and a lot of different meat. The desserts were good and there were a lot of options. The staff was good. Overall it is a good buffet place. If you can eat a lot then this place is for you!!",positive
"One of the best barbeques i have visited ever! Love love love the food,starters, desserts, maincourse what not! The staffs are so courteous and they treated us so well Specially i would love to mention Gurusharan ,he was so attentive to all our requests as well as i would appreciate the work of Ashish(manager) for his hospitality . Overwhelmed and happy. Must visit",positive
"The Dining Experience was great. The staffs were corteous and trying there best to serve the customers. Talking about the food, they offer really good varities of starters, main course and desserts. You can find variety of meats from rabbits, quail, squids etc. They also have good options for vegetarians.",positive
My personal fav...rather our family restaurant All the starters are just awesome Desserts are heavenly...they pamper u... Above all the staff is way too good... our personal favourite Veer (who is now in Hyderabad) and Ashish who treats us so well,positive

ABs in BTM is located in Prime location near to Petrol Pump. It's a perfect place for outing with group of people.

"AB's is a very well known food chain for BBQ , I visited this place during Brazilian Carnival Food festival where they had fully decorated the place with Brazilian theme and had lots of Brazilian dishes. Ambience - Well Decorated ambience, good one for buffet. Service - Wonderful service, Immediate response and nominal time delivery. We tried out BBQ of Prawns, fish, mushroom, chicken, BBQ Sliced pineapple. Tried out Brazilian special dishes as well, lots of varieties in general. Vegetarian dishes like potato steak, pastels were good. For main course Started with Brazilian chicken foot soup, chicken biryani, Crab masala cirry. Deserts They had more than 10 varieties from pastries to rasmalai. Cold stone ice cream was also available with all flavours. Wonderful place for corporate, family or friends outing.",positive
"The name justify's what this place is all about! Been here for the Brazilian Food Carnival and I was in the mood to fire up the grill and have myself some vegetarian Barbeque! A beautiful Brazilian theme setup right from the entry area and even till the exit. Excellent place for food lovers/Non Vegetarians as they have a exotic menu with grilled barbeques,wide range of buffet,chats section, dessert and what not? They never failed to impress with the service and qaulity of food! Buffet/BBQ had a lot of options to choose from. The place is quite spacious to have a large group for lunch/dinner. Parking space is available even though it's in the main road of buzzing BTM layout! Finally the dessert section stole my heart with more then 10 varieties of options! Highly recommend and best place for buffet at a reasonable price‚ú®",positive
"Acaraje, Brazilian Collards, American Cheese Potatoes, Frango Grelhado, Bahin Barbeque Fish, Brazilian Vatapi and yes, we are speaking Brazilian Food in Namma Bengaluru. These exotic dishes are from the Brazilian Food Carnival of Absolute Barbeques. With a man dressed as on a Brazilian beach, selling Tequila shots and enchanting Brazilian board games, the theme has completely been setup for the carnival. With all the Brazilian delicacies we also get served the amazing Barbequeas. The desserts are good and the spread of the buffer is huge and ABs never disappoints with its food. Like always, they have exotic meats with both veg and non vegetarian category. The service is fantastic and food is great. Had a good time here. Bon Appetit, Ghatotkatcha",positive
Perfect place to die for Barbeques. Enjoy the starters with great variety and main course also fills your tummy with taste. Lastly finger licking deserts and ice cream calms your fiery stomach. Loved the ambience and hospitality.,positive
"Absolute Barbecue!! Best known for its meat and food. Yes! Everything about this place is just daam. Say it be service or food or ambiance or food presentation!! One of the most recommended places for buffet. You have different types of sea food here.. and all are just finger licking good. Therefore, I give this place a high 5 score!",positive
Very polite staff..even performed a small dance...humble and fast service...I am a vegetarian but I heard from my fellow companions that non veg was great...I personally didn't like the veg food...it was just average...dessert was great..gulabjamun and rasmalai were yum,positive
It was a pleasant experience!! AB's stands out in all ways compared to the competition...they have consistently been good and that what's amazing!! I would recommend this over any other barbeque buffet. The exotic counter is just amazing...it would be better to have more people working it cause it's very crowded here and people get irritated on the wait. Our next table neighbour were complaining loudly about the service just cause of that so it's better fixing it.,positive
I love ABs sea food live grill. It's an adventure in itself. The starters are all my favourite. I love their sugarcane kebabs as well. The lil noodle bowl with squid octopus and Jamaican sauce is also a favourite. All in all one of the best places to visit. This was my first time visit to the Whitefield outlet and it is as good as the Marathalli one. There hospitality is one of the best.,positive
Friendly and courteous staff.. Alway good to visit this place.. Food is awesome as there is Brazilian festival going and they have lots off Verity... Most important is dance performance by staff was super And we played game as well which kept near entry gate... So over all spend very good time with friends..,positive

"Went for office lunch... great ambience... great hospitality... Live counter was great... Nothing extraordinary about main course but starters and desserts were good... Chicken legs roast were a bit undercooked n raw inside... should take care of that... Complimentary drink was okay-ish. Thanks, team AB's",positive
"Went there with the team for early dinner, as always and like other outlet of AB‚Äôs this place is also good. Food taste is good as well as the menu. Best thing is the staff who will spoil you with there service and suggestions. Pradhan served us and he was very good. Bar also available...",positive

A north Indian vegetarian writing this review. We have visited the marathalli branch before and as this one was more famous we decided to go here this time. To our disappointment it was nowhere like it's other center. Too congested. May be because of the location. You will have to take time to figure out where is what. Taste wise it's different from the other center. Hospitality also is not as exceptional like the other one. Overall as we had the same expectation like it's other branch we got disappointed but for first timers it's a good place to visit and have fun.,negative
Black pearl is one of the most classes buffer location in Bangalore got great range of starters both veg and non veg.... Along with like this theme and this is a food that this is very unique in nature and we don't get a lot of seafood in Bangalore.....

"Love the ambience, during dinner you will have live music.

Desserts 8/10 we had payesam here, custard was good,pan flavour ice cream roll also good.)",positive
We went here quite late so didn't had much time but still brought the starters fast enough to serve us. We liked the main course as it was quite delicious. Also the the dessert section was plentiful. Other live counters for chats and pizza was also fine but felt it could have been better. Our server Manas was very helpful and courteous. He made sure our food was prepared according to our taste. Overall this place is a must try for buffet lovers and has an amazing pirate themed ambience.,positive
Food is very good. Ambience is too good.Good decor and very courteous stuff. Good service from Shivlal and Vikram. Live music.Live counter as well.

"BBQ on table restaurant. Went for team lunch on August 21, 2019, booked a table for us. If you have been to a 5 star dine-in restaurants and enjoyed food in calm place, you will definitely not like this place. And if you have been to BBQ restaurant, you will like this. Good place who likes unlimited non-veg BBQs. Points which I don't like: 1. No AC 2. Pirate theme ambiance - too dark 3. Starters were spicy and full Orangee color 4. Chaotic 5. No peace to have relaxed food. 6. Didn't take all main course 7. Too crowded Points I like: 1. Complimentary unlimited mocktails for first 1 hour. 2. Staffs are good and helpful. 3. Dedicated parking is available But still I couldn't give more than 2 stars, sorry I have been to 5 star restaurants and expected a clam place to have food. Anyways best wishes for your services.",negative
A pirate themed restaurant. We went on a Saturday so the place was pretty chaotic. Buffet places mostly are chaotic. The food was really good. The kids enjoyed it's lot.,positive
Visited Black Pearl for a office dinner party. One of the best buffet options in marathahalli. Multiple starter and dessert options. Really happy with the service by Rajkumar. Looking forward to visiting it again.,positive
"The pirate theme of this restaurant is the thing that impressed me a lot,the food tasted good.The chicken,fish,prawns,mutton all tasted good and even the squid was good,the biryani did not have salt in it and the chocolate ball wasn't so good,the reamining deserts and main courses and chocolate sandwich were also good.In the beverages I just loved the blue ocean which was a kind of litchi juice.The ambience was also good.One staff member named rajkumar served us well.Overall was impressed by this place.It is a good place to visit for team meetings and family get togethers.",positive
"Went here for team lunch!! The buffet spread was quite good for both veg and non-veg !! Brahma did an amazing job while serving us. This place has a pirate themed ambience!! They have live pizza , pasta and Chaat corners. Dessert sections was really good.",positive
As all dr sheesha hookah was awesome ..didnt like the ambience that much as it was too closed n packed..they was serve beer n alcohol..food was nice ..staff was well behaved n knowledgeable..main point is its open 24/7 ..if u want todo hookah at night ..u can visit,positive
"1 star extra for being the first restaurant to serve hookah near E-city. Though the ambience is not very great , the fast service and great hookah compensate for it. The food was good as well. The restaurant claims to be opened till 5am but the last order was at 12am. The staff informed that the timings are for future , hope they follow it soon.",positive

"I loved the food and ambience, along with some amazing music. My personal favourite is the Alfredo Pasta and Chicken 65 which were yummy üòã Thanks to Pramod, for helping us choose the delicious foodsüëçüèª",positive
"So they recently opened in marathalli. Marathalli is not a party place as compared to kormangala or indranagar, so if you want to relax or chill with your friends in a less crowded places, this is for you. We ordered sheesha, at an amazing price of 499/-, but they couldn't make it properly. It was chocking, and when we asked them to fix the this, they couldn't. Waiters politely explained it is because of vanilla flavor, but I have been smoking sheesha from a long time and I know it's not the flavor. Then we ordered shakes, they were great, but a little bit expensive. For food we ordered Manchurian, which was extremely tasty. But pizza was a no. Overall great place, but if you find your hukkah chocking, plz ask them to replace.",negative
"I quite frequently go to this place for hookah mostly , They serve all veg food which is good. The food is not over priced and quite affordable. The hookah is good.. The only thing is you need to climb 4 floors by the stairs to reach this place. The staff is attentive. This place stays open till 1 A. M. In the locality(jayanagar &j.p; nagar) I think this place serves good hookah than other places nearby to it.",positive
"Dr.Sheesha JP Nagar. Best place for sheesha, awesome place to hangout with friends, super ambience. I loved the service and food here. Live screening and well maintained rooftop Cafe in JP Nagar. ambience :5/5 quality : 5/5 service : 5/5 taste : 5/5 value for money : 4/5 overall : 5/5",positive
"An amazingly beautiful and an equally gigantic place. I am yet to see another place equally big and so well designed as this. Worth every insta story you may want to share. Food : liked it all barring jumbo prawns, we found them too blad for our taste. Beer is good too. Music : Too good to not tap ( we had gone on a Saturday night) Ambiance: Perfect Two areas where there's scope of improvement : a. Service - For us to even get the menu it took multiple requests, and this is after we getting assigned to some three different people who could help find a seat for us. b. Some tables are placed at such dark locations that you'd literally have to keep your phone torch on for the whole meal. If you get an option, do choose a well lit place ( most I guess come with their subscription services).",positive
"It is one of the biggest bar in terms of space and the fantastic ambience with the amazing crowd of all age group. The cocktail, mocktail and all the dishes were just awesome except pizza. It has a pool also which is the sparkling spot for selfies.",positive
"Well having heard a lot about their Sunday Brunch thought of paying a visit. I sure must say it was not a pleasant one, starting from the hostesses at the entrance till the serving staff had a very bad attitude.. Probably they were overwhelmed of the crowd. Coming to the food nothing that can wow you expect for the beer n pizza, mocktails were much ok, rest was a regular affair what gets served mostly everywhere.. But I should mention that the staff have to get their attitude right.. I can't even begin to explain.. This is going to be a no go place for a very long time now.. I've dined in best n finest of dining places and Byg Brewski was a big let down.",negative

"Had been to the evening Sundrunch to Byg Brewsky. First and foremost the ambience is like a movie set. Absolutely stunning. There's a river inside the restaurant! Need i say more? Theres a huge variety when it comes to food. Was very surprised at the number of live counters. There was a counter for everything imaginable. There were meats being grilled, parathas, chat, momos. The salad counter was a revelation with really wacky dressings. Service could have been better though probably because of the weekend crowd. Love the variety on offer. Very good value for money.",positive
"Love the ambiance. One can get a bit lost in the enormous setup, initially. The staff is a bit disoriented due the sheer size of the crowd they have to cater to but reasonable anyhow. Food and drink options are awesome and fairly priced. Would go there again for the feel of it.",positive
"Byg Brewski is one of India's largest microbrewery! Located at Hennur,since this place is the largest in India one can imagine how big and nice the place would be! With a beautiful artificial pond and candle light dinner just beside that is something one craves for! I had been for the Sun Drunch and was delighted to see the crowd partying on a Sunday with the place completely packed! Did dig into starters arranged in. Buffet system with starters to dessert you have everything included in the Sundrunch option! Ambience is just so perfect with many times of seating option which is available! I loved the food and loved the beer and cocktails too. I would definitely recommended one as this place needs that hype as it is such a beautiful place üòç Service was real quick, courteous staff and best place for a place to beautiful brunch.

"This place doesn't need any introduction!! Located at Hennur. This place has everything you could ask for!!! Beautiful ambiance, good food, live music and events, great service, unique and refreshing cocktails and amazing brewed beers. I went on Sunday evening, opted for SunDrunch brunch. This amazing brunch includes all types of cuisines ranging from Indian, Pan Asian, Italian, Chinese. A perfect Night buffet to forget about the following Monday Blues!!! Prices are reasonable too judging by the options they have provided. Since there are so many options , I missed some of the good ones. Most of the starters are on live counter. I loved their chicken kebabs, paired perfectly with brewed beers. Don't miss out the Karari Roti. The Huggeeeee space giving you absolute party kinda vibes is a definite heart robber ! It's super happening, super romantic with the pool side candlelight dinner ! Staff are courteous and well-trained.",positive
"Located in Hennur, Byg Brewsky is most famous for its Sunday Brunches and as such I decided to try it out the past week. The ambiance was fantastic and is like nothing I have seen before. The variety in food and staff were great too. The only let down was the time it took to serve the individual tables. At times we waited over 20 minutes for a drink. The staff were lovely but I dont think they were able to manage with the huge influx of guests which caused the efficiency to dwindle and delay every order that was placed.",positive

"Before visiting this place I was wondering how a pub can get such a high rating, after visiting this place I got clarity. Undoubtedly, this place deserves it, starting from the ambiance to the Dj to food to service everything was excellent. When comes to food, this place is heaven for party lovers. We ordered Chili chicken, Red Chicken Pizza, Veg Nachos. The taste of each dish was extremely exceptional, I personally loved veg nachos. Cocktails were pretty good too. Lastly, thank you BUDDHA for servings us such delicious foods. Your service was mind-blowing. Overall, I would recommend this place to each and everyone out there who are food and party, lovers.

"Probably the best bar in the entire City, Byg Brewski is definitely the place to be on a Saturday night. With amazing music, the best ambiance, and moderate pricing, it‚Äôs ticked all my boxes to be a winner. They have some great deals on shots and pitchers and I love the pizzas here too. This is my GO TO place on a weekend!",positive
"It is one of the most visited place in Bangalore for sure, The menu is elaborate from indian to oriental to continental. You will find something for everyone. The menu is big but the choice of items is good for both veg and non veg. So there is no chance of some one going home unhappy with the food. In the few visits that I have had, I have tried a lot of things pizza, baos, kadi chawal, noodles, Thai curry you name it I have had it (veg). So there are lot of reviews, positive ones and many people have already been here. My purpose of writing the review is to reiterate that this is a great place for a good team lunch or fun filled evening with your gang. Kids are allowed too.",positive
"Came here on a Saturday night, got a seat on the second floor. It's pretty dark.. and the waiters are a confused/fun lot. Despite the plenty wrong/delayed orders, the food is really good :D Tried the Bangalore Hot (Pepperoni) Pizza and Meat & More Meat Pizza - was finished in seconds, was so good! Perfect thin base and crust. Ordered a trio of fries and the Chicken Wings - these were long pieces, not like the usual wings.. the quantity was so generous and this was definitely MUST TRY of the night. Tasted delicious. Ordered a bunch of variety drinks - Belgian Wit, cocktails, mojitos, sangria and shots. Overall was a good experience. There's a lot of tables we noticed who mainly came for the food, and I for sure will return for the same!",positive
"A sure shot winner when it comes to dining by the pool and having great buffers for some soul food. If you haven't gotten a chance to visit byg brewski, do it now. The Hennur one is bigger but I love the Sarjapur one for its convenient location and great food + drinks. Go on a Sunday for some wholesome brunch and you won't be disappointed.",positive
"This is one the better places in Bangalore. The food is really very nice and tasty. The ambience is amazing and worth a couple of clicks. Every dish we ordered was worthy except the pasta as it's quantity was very less. But the best dishes we had were Hong Kong chilly paneer, paneer butter masala and cheese sticks. The place is usually over crowded and you should definitely reserve a table before going. Try for a poolside table as it has the best view in the house. Service is very quick. It's a must visit in Bangalore.",positive
"The first opinion you make when you enter is their ambiance, this place is not that huge!, This is one of the most peacefully decorated and pleasant resto bar I've ever been, it has its own brewery and it's famous for it's compact looks. So many items and everything looked tempting. One cannot eat everything unless you have a good appetite. Good crowd as well.",positive
"Oh boy, What a place, ambiance, food, People, Everything here is soo great. the ambiance is beautiful for your every occasion be it a date, friend gathering, party or anything the food is delicious and quality is fabulous. Whatever I say will be less for here",positive
"Byg brewski has a new menu. They almost surprise me everytime I go and this time was no different. For beer, the staff named Buddha recommended a mango cider infused variation and it was so yumm. Totally made my evening. Along with it had some melt in mouth chicken ghee roast and thin crispy cheesy perfectly done nachos. For dessert I was about to go for the salted caramel cheesecake but a staff named Sujit suggested that I must try Tres Leches and man he was right. The best tres Leches ever. Not only was the cake moist and creamy but it came in a dish filled with sweet thick milk. Not think like condensed milk but just the right consistency. As I took a spoonful of cake, dunked it in thick milk and had it along, oh my that was purely heaven. Highly recommend to buy this for dessert.",positive
"Quality:- 4/5 Ambience:- 4/5 Service:- 5/5 A good place to have a buffet. Non-vegetarian snacks variety is limited to 4 also main course variety is less. Taste is good, they always take care of taste, if satisfying then they'll cook according to you. Variety of dessert, one of best buffet dessert I found till now. A good place to spend time with family or colleagues.",positive
"I went with my office team for lunch to this place on a Monday. Their prices are lower on Monday's compared to the other days. They served a crispy corn starter with raw onion which everyone enjoyed. Other starters included Veg Kebab, Potato with skins in a sauce, Babycorn fry, Pani Puri & Papdi Chat. Coming to the barbecues, all the items on the skewers were fresh - watermelon, Paneer, pineapple, potato, Paneer, Mushroom & sweetcorn. They attended to us regularly to check if everything was okay. I personally felt the marinade could've been better and needed more garlic. Didn't think I'd say this, but the main course here was better than the barbecues, contrary to what one would think. I Also tried the Italian Smooch mocktail which was good. Overall it was a good experience, but could've been a little better on the taste aspect for every item including desserts.",positive
"Barbeque Nation has started Ramadan Special Menu with wide variety of Ramadan delicacies, and it is open till 1AM in the morning.

If I have to say about the food, music, place, ambience I would be rating it 11/10 The food was superb and the best part is every time I have visited they have some special dished which attracts a lot. From starter to the desert. I love it from top to bottom. Ambience is good and the music which made your mood happy. Staff are so good and friendly. This place I love because they suggest you which is good. Overall this place is happening and perfect for team outing, family occassion or any other things. I would personally day mr.

"Had been to Barbeque Nation to try their electrifying dishes specially curated for ""The Chilly Fest"" that's going on now. The service was quite good as always. The waiters were courteous and well mannered. The food festival displayed a wide variety of chillies from different parts of the world and you can customise the level of spiciness in your dishes in accordance with your tolerance level. The drinks were pretty amazing and the food was decent. However,the food served from the live counter could have been better. If you like spicy food, you should go for this!",positive
nice place which opens at 7 PM. food quality is good...service is great..variety is appreciated...Being an early bird you get a discount. Liked the mocktails offered. We order a variety of mocktails and enjoyed every bit of it,negative
"The best barbeque food in Bangalore!! Their seafood barbeque is absolutely drool worthy, soo soft and tender cooked to perfection, you choose the kinda masala that you wish for, the staff here are super sweet and provide great service.

Mohammed Rafi was the person who served us & I must say he was good professional & he has one of my fav singer‚Äôs name. Btw coming back to food, starters was really filling but it was very spicy as per me though he said it‚Äôs medium spicy. So who has issues with spicy food pls keep them informed.

"Wonderful food (veg and non veg both), very fast service, in non veg options are - chicken, fish, prawn, mutton plus they were serving many items like smash patato, corn, fruits ...

Place was much crowded. But no compromise on quality I would say. We really love the lasagna. It was loaded with cheese and the garlic breads were too soft and yummy. New York cheese cake was good. Though we felt some spices could be added on those fries. They were too plain. Burgers is a must here. They will really fill your tummies. On the whole was a good experience. Food - 4/5 Staffs - 4/5 Ambience - 3.5/5,positive
"Visited the famous Truffles and was met by huge crowd and long wait time. Tried All American Cheese Burger, Peri Peri Chicken Burger, Fried Chicken Fries and Mojito.

Would recommend this place for a nice time with friends.",positive
"Visited Truffles after a Longggggg time. This use to be one of my most visited place when I was in Koramangala. And this place was and is always crowded, which clearly shows how the food will be. Its has become more spacious now, which I liked as the old one was conjested. A place which is very famous for its food specially Burgers So I had the Smoked Chicken Sausage and Salsa. It was really good. A little tangy, with a dash of sweetness and spicy. The sausage gave the Smoky flavour making it taste really really good. Also, had Cheese Burger where the Patty it self was Cheese and when you take a bite, cheese just oozes out. A must try burger. For drinks, I had the Passion fruit ice tea. It tasted good and was very refreshing Overall a good lunch. The ambiance was good. The service could have been a little better.",positive
"This brand doesn't need any introduction.. my favorite dish there is the all American cheese burger , ferroro rocher shake, hazelnut shake and red sauce pasta.. this place is always crowded so do expect a small waiting to dine in there",positive
Great place to hang out with friends. There are multiple outlets of Truffles in Bangalore but the one in koromangala is the best of all. Food: 4/5 Prompt service:5/5 Ambience:5/5,positive
"One of the best places to have burgers & desserts!! The place is affordable and its quite famous. Sometimes its way too crowded to get a quick table confirmation, so u might have to wait for 10-20 mins. Their service is faster and the food is fresh!! Coming to the ambience, trust me it wont disappoint u! Must try!! BURGERS, CHEESECAKES, OREO/FERREROROCHERS/KITKAT SHAKES. Have a happy meal!",positive
I think this place is overrated for their burgers. I really didnt find it too good. I tried their all American cheese veg burger. The portion size is really good. Taste was average. Presentation is really good and they serve quick. The best part about this burger is it has a fried cheese patty which is too good. You must try this if you are a cheese lover. I was really impressed with their desserts. I tried their lava cake and oreo cheese cake. Oreo cheese cake was amazing. Lava cake was too but I wish it was hot. In the end its a good place to hangout with your buddies. Ambience is pretty good.,positive
This is one such amazing places in Bangalore. Was in a hurry that day and couldn't take too many pics.. Buy the food was really good ü§©üëåüëå. Tasty and the quantity for that price was worthy üëçüëç. That's why I say Bengaluru people have a reason to love any place üòÉü§òü§ò. Cheese toast and Paneer Tikka was amazing ü§©ü§©,positive
Place was much crowded. But no compromise on quality I would say. We really love the lasagna. It was loaded with cheese and the garlic breads were too soft and yummy. New York cheese cake was good. Though we felt some spices could be added on those fries. They were too plain. Burgers is a must here. They will really fill your tummies. On the whole was a good experience. Food - 4/5 Staffs - 4/5 Ambience - 3.5/5,positive
"Visited the famous Truffles and was met by huge crowd and long wait time. Tried All American Cheese Burger, Peri Peri Chicken Burger, Fried Chicken Fries and Mojito. The burger was quite tasty and much as it was fabled. The taste, quantity was quite fulfilling as per the value of money. The staff was courteous and service was quick. Would recommend this place for a nice time with friends.",positive
"Visited Truffles after a Longggggg time. This use to be one of my most visited place when I was in Koramangala. And this place was and is always crowded, which clearly shows how the food will be. Its has become more spacious now, which I liked as the old one was conjested. A place which is very famous for its food specially Burgers So I had the Smoked Chicken Sausage and Salsa. It was really good. A little tangy, with a dash of sweetness and spicy. The sausage gave the Smoky flavour making it taste really really good. Also, had Cheese Burger where the Patty it self was Cheese and when you take a bite, cheese just oozes out. A must try burger. For drinks, I had the Passion fruit ice tea.

"When it comes satisfaction, Truffles have done this recently when I placed an order for close to 300 burger combos which included cortege cheese and tandoori chicken burger for my entire team at work. The delivery was remarkable and since I was told about this joint by many to go for, didn't have any hurdles in coordinating with them. Polite and professional with great service is what I got from them. Though it was a bulk order, the quality wasn't compromised on a single element and that proves to me as a customer that they have that dedication. I'm sure to go with them whenever I have the possibility and individually, I'm impressed. The food was fresh and hot and the mojito was simply chilled and refreshing. Great job guy!!",positive
"Thursdays we didn't thought it would be crowded, but it was. Think about how good they are! Ambiance is good with varied type of seating but we never got to choose as it's mostly occupied. They have AC & Non AC seatings too. Service is quick & neat - we never had to wait for placing the order, food also arrived quick. We ordered two burger (truffle roaster & crisp cross) truffles roaster was the better choice. Starters were cheese chicken fries & normal fries both will be recommended. Deserts are must. Pocket friendly, we tried XL burgers which was too much for me hence got rest of the stuff parcel, if you have big appetite then only order XL burgers.",positive
"Superb food, superb service, nice ambience, good portion size, great value for money, you guys are simply rock, cheers to your chef, service and entire team. Keep it up,",positive
Has to be one of the best food places. The steak here is the best. I've tried the cheesecake here and it was yum too. The seating here is a bit limited though.,positive
"Craving for some impeccable burgers, some scrumptious pasta, amazing appetizers and some lovely dessert to finish off your meal and drool over - head over to truffles. Though the place might be bit crowded, it's worth the wait for a really happy belly. I had ordered some chicken soup, rolls, hot dog, crispy corn stick for appetizers. Some amazing peri peri chicken burger for my main. Red velvet cupcake to finish my wholesome meal with. Cannot complain about the price either as it's worth paying for every bite. Cheer truffles!",positive
A must visit place in bangalore. Their dessert needs a special mention and so does their steak . A pleasant place to hang out with friends.Better for a non veg person than a veg person.,positive
"I couldn‚Äôt expect anything better, when i ordered chicken peri peri burger , chicken kebabs , friazzo biscutii and coke (standard drink) . I loved the taste of food and potato fries with burger, were obviously cherry on the top. Also specifically the quality of chicken in the burger was mouth melting. I am looking forward to visit this place again",positive
Have eaten from here on a few occasions and it has been a good experience each time. GREEN APPLE GRANITA is my favourite and the one thing that pulls me back to this place. Ordered a Dutch Truffle Sundae on the recommendation of the staff-was wonderful!,positive
"If you crave for good food and do not want to disappoint yourself at any cost,visit truffles.They have the magic wand to make everything perfect.Startung from steaks to burgers,normal french fries to shakes,club sandwiches to desserts , everything about this place is perfect.I have been here several times only for my unsatiated love for perfection.The fish and chips was perfectly crispy and succulent like always,the only place to serve perfect fish and chips after the Britos of Goa.I basically am a chicken person but I had this opportunity to try veg club sandwich and Mac and cheese here and trust me it's delicious üòã.The famous ferrero richer shake along with the ferrero richer chocolate pastry made my mind blow.I could continue for more and more but I'd suggest just pop in here to know more. Happy eating üòÅ",positive
"This is literally anyone's go-to place if you're studying in Ramaiah. Visited here a dozen times and was never disappointed. Great taste of food, great quantity and worth the money! Love the main courses, steaks, burgers, pizza, slushes, desserts, EVERYTHING.",positive
"Great food, great location. We ordered burger, steak and both were nice. Parking is an issue on weekends. Hope they take care of it. Definitely a mustvist place for all burger lovers.",positive
"Truffles has been around for a long time serving good food. This outlet is very big and crowded most of the time but we were seated almost immediately. Food is delicious with good portion size, and pocket friendly too. Also great ambiance and great service!!",positive
Famous outlet for young crowds and food lovers so finding a place to sit could be challenging. Nonetheless the wait is rewarding once you receive the food ordered. It's yummy üòã. Steaks always the favourite.,positive
It is One of my favourite place to hangout. Have visited this place a lot of time and will continue to do so because of my love for those tasty burgers and Oreo and cookie fudge. Absolutely love it.,positive
"This was my first ever visit! . Ambience, This has a 3 floored building, everything was lit up! It was too good! . What we triedüçΩÔ∏è ü•òCheese sticks, mixed with oregano and chilli flakes was too good ü•òMac n Cheese, I was expecting a bit more cheesy but it felt like a lot more white sauce pasta! But it was yumm ü•òPanner steak, the sauce which they used was bad, I didn't like it other than that everything was too good! ü•òBurger, forgot the proper name, it was done by beans, a complete different taste! . Overall! A nice place to hang out! Would love to try in their different branch as well!",positive
"Been here to savour some desserts after a horrible lunch. It was not my first time here. I love the desserts here. Especially the blueberry cheesecake, Oreo cake n red velvet cake. Tried the Dutch truffle n it was yum. The portion was satisfyingly good. This is more of a compliment than I review!",positive
"Tucked just on the busy roads of BEL road , this place is a must visit. I have heard that their burgers are juicy and its extremely famous for its XL size. As I'm really not a burger person, I went and ordered CORN KAUN which is Skewered Babycorn in BBQ sauce , Garlic bread with cheese , Veg A-la king : Vegetables cooked in creamy white sauce served with herbed rice and washed it off with Lime soda . Everything was amazing. I loved the Babycorn and my main course . Cooked to perfection and the flavours were amazing . Loved every bite of my food . As the name says Truffles .. I wanted to have a chocolate truffle but I was extremely full and satisfied with my order . A must visit place in Blore",positive
"I always like the place even though you have to wait to get the place for sitting still it's worth waiting always. I love all Americans burger, paneer burger. Like have tired almost everything in menu and i loved it. Ambiance is good. Place is always full croud is good music is also good. Do visit the place you'll love the food.",positive

SangSang is great ! Place is lively.,positive
Hoot is a famous microbrewery in Sarjapur. Food is a bit expensive and not soo great. The staff is very irritating regarding the feedback for them. They came after every 15 minutes to check whether we gave them rating online. Except for the staff everything was amazing. Love the ambience,positive
"I always have amazing experience coming here. Loved this place top to bottom. Beer is always good. Their special oktober menu Found this new thing plum corn in menu so downright delicious with this Bourbon, rose mary cocktail. Halloween decorations and courteous staff and fast delivery. Everything is perfect to start your weekend.",positive
"Went to hoot after work with my team of 25 people. Had a great evening with lots of drinks, some good food and a really nice vibe. The place has an amazing ambiance and multiple places to sit. The food was great too, my favourite dish was the mutton Seekh. They have a variety of choices in drinks as well, and I enjoyed a few craft beers. They have various discounts like Zomato gold for drinks or 20% off for CRED users so it‚Äôs a pretty budget friendly place as well. Overall I had a great time. Only negative was that we went very early in the evening so they weren‚Äôt playing music at the time.",positive
"If you are looking for a perfect party place / or a peaceful lunch, hoot is the place for you üòÑ I tried the October fest menu and loved the food and beer they served.

"Magnolia Bakery all the way from New York üòÉ Wonderful deserts which they serve is too good with fresh ones The best was Tres leches , it‚Äôs just so soft and nice to eat , completing one is just one big meal üòâ And banana pudding where it is known for it , is dam yummy and must try along with others Long queues since it‚Äôs new but worth it The cheesecake lovers have wide variety of choice Ambiance is simple and sober and pricing is high but can try for one time Overall good experience and must try and sweetu tooth people would love it for sure",positive
"Yes and no! Yes the place is nice, I love their 'tres leches', it's definitely worth the try and even the Cheese cake is good. But why only 3 stars on the review? It's definitely not worth the price. Yes it's a big New York based brand, but it's just not worth 145 rs for a cupcake.",negative
"Well lit bakery where you will see a long queue waiting outside to eat their favourite desserts and the wait is worth it. Cupcakes, cheesecakes, etc everything is tasty. The only problem is the small seating area, rest everything is good. Try it out if you're in the vicinity!",positive
"The iconic New-York based bakery chain is finally here in Bengaluru. known for it's world famous cupcakes, they are fresh and tasty and have a wide variety to choose from. the bakery is filled with pastel colors, bunting, and lots of decor. the banana pudding is as good as everyone claims it to be, It's worth a visit to the Magnolia Bakery just to eat their fabulous banana pudding. slightly overpriced for cupcakes and queuing out of the door sometimes. there are only few tables and chairs to enjoy a cup of coffee and a cupcake.",positive
"Magnolia Bakery from NYC is a revelation in the world of desserts. Amazing fresh ingredients, new flavours and old classics make for a unique experience. The tres leches cake is moist and flavorful and topped with fresh whipped cream and blueberries. The chocolate cupcakes are to die for! The classic banana pudding is a must-try for all you banana lovers and pudding enthusiasts. The apple walnut muffin is delicious and boasts the freshest crunchiest apples on the inside. I really don't know how they do it but I'm glad that they came all the way to Bangalore!",positive
"Last week when I was passing by Indiranagar, noticed this newly opened place.. And I was trying to understand why there's a long queue infront of the shop, though the shop is quite decent in size.. By googling got to know about this place which is very famous bakery in New York City.. So without wasting time I decided to give it a try, had to wait for almost 15 mins to get my turn, but believe me that's so worth ..Ended up buying Lemon bar, caramel toffee bar, muffins, lime cheese cake and vanilla cheesecake with blueberry toppings ..The total bill was around 1200 .. Later got to know about their banana pudding which is very famous in New York, will check for the next time if I will get.. My pick would be lemon bar (the proper lemon taste and so soft which melts inside the mouth) and caramel toffee bar..",positive
Ready to DROOL? I was invited to an exclusive showcase of the world renowned Magnolia Bakery India opening their first ever bakery here in India and that too in Bangalore Indiranagar. As part of the event we were trained on how they do icing on their cupcakes. Sharing some pictures of my talent. But when we got to taste the cupcakes and their cheese cakes I realised why they were the most raved about place in New York. You have to try it to believe it. I am definitely going back for more on the day of their opening which will be tomorrow the 7th of November for Public. Do yourself a favour and go try their cheese cakes and thank me later. wompindia.com,positive
"Magnolia Bakery, the famous bakery from NYC opened in Bangalore a few days ago. I visited Magnolia on Day 2, and it was pretty crowded. The bakery is popular for it's cupcakes with buttercream frosting in pastel hues. They have an array of cheesecakes and puddings too. I opted for a vanilla cupcake with vanilla buttercream and a carrot cupcake. I was barely in the store for 5 minutes, but I liked the vibe and the floral decor. Now, coming to the cupcakes, they tasted good. But, the frosting was a tad bit oversweet for my liking. I found the vanilla frosting too sugary. The carrot cupcake's frosting was excessively sweet too, but the Walnut crumbles on this one balanced the overall flavour. The pricing is steep, but then again it's an established international brand. Will I visit again? Yes, I need to try a bunch of other sweet goodies and I do see myself visiting them periodically.",positive
"Having been to the one in NYC, I really wondered if this would live up to the standards and it sure as hell does!! The Flavours are definitely there! They look just as perfect as I remember them and the menu options are great. The carrot cupcake is my all time favorite! So moist and delicious. The lemon bars pack just the right amount of citrusy punch. The decor is adorable and creates an ambiance that is inviting. The service is good too. Definitely going to be going back multiple times.",positive
"The very famous Sex and the city scene where they have the cupcakes from here can never be forgotten. Well, Bangalore got its own Magnolia now, at Indiranagar. Famous for it's cupcakes, check this place out for it's great desserts. From cupcakes, cakes, cheesecakes, ice creams there's a large variety of desserts to choose from. Personal favorite is the Banana pudding. And do try their cakes. Cupcakes would definitely give a sugar rush!",positive

"Toit was one of the top picks on my bucketlist when I moved to Bangalore. Glad that I finally got the chance to visit one of Bangalore's most sought after breweries. Their brews have unique taste and we specially liked the Toit Weiss among the 6 standard flavours and the Halloween special, the Pumpkin Ale. Baked Nachos was top notch with the Mexican beans and cheese. Chicken wings was also good. The toit full house pizza was well baked and very cheesy. I enjoyed the Mai Tai cocktail as well. Service was very swift given that we went during a full house on a Sunday afternoon. Staff are very courteous. A revisit is surely on the cards. Thank you, Team Toit. ‚ù§Ô∏è",positive
"Toit is the best place to go if you want really good food, drinks and ambiance. It's always packed crowded but totally worth the wait. My favourite food from there are wings, the chicken nachos and their pepperoni pizza",positive

"So well finally after so much of hype i decided to try To!t with my friends. But i NVR expected this will turn into a bad experience. The ambiance is super cool no doubt abt it. Drinks are little expensive but tats ok but the food is totally waste. We ordered peri peri cheese fries, andra chilli chicken, bbq chicken wings. But none of the food satisfied me or my friends. There are many pubs in that same surrounding wch serves low priced craft beers with great food and ambiance.",negative
"My friends and I visited the place. They had beer and I had a cocktail as I'm not a beer person. We had ordered three varieties of beer, i don't remember the names though but the Cocktail was Bacardi Mojito. For starters we had ordered Chicken Wings, Lemon Chicken and Onion rings. Totally loved the flavour of the Peri Peri Wings and the Lemon Chicken. For maian course we had ordered Pizza, don't remember the name but it was equally good..üòç",positive
"One of the best microbreweries I've been to. Love the vibe at this place. All the beers are good. The oktoberfest was one of the best lagers I've had. For appetisers I tried the Cajun Potato Wedges, Mac & Cheese balls and onion rings. Cajun Potato wedges were the right amount of crispy and tasted amazing too. Mac & Cheese balls were decent but wouldn't recommend the Onion rings. They were too oily and the coating on the onion rings kept falling off completely. Would recommend the toit full house pizza and the Tartufo. Limited options for Veg but Tartufo was a must try. For desserts I tried the layer cake which was rich and chocolaty, just the way I like it.",positive
Ellarigu Namaskara! It was a weekday that we have been a group of 5 around 5pm. The crowd was a bit less and they started coming in big numbers after 6pm. They have variety of craft beers with different sizes. Food prices were bit on higher side but it was tasty though. It‚Äôs very close to metro station so not to worry on connectivity. Ambience: 4.5/5 Price: 4/5 Service: 5/5 Food: 4/5 Overall a good place to hangout.,positive
"Nice full house bar with its own brewery. Generally crowded in weekends and very difficult to get entry. Brewed beers are worth trying and it taste awesome. Food is nice, ambience is great, staffs are friendly and polite, what else. Also price is very reasonable. Three floors are there with brewery at the bottom. I have been here couple of times and every time I just had a wonderful time. If you are planning to visit please do a pre-booking before you go for a pleasant experience.",positive

"Toit is the best place to go if you want really good food, drinks and ambiance. It's always packed crowded but totally worth the wait. My favourite food from there are wings, the chicken nachos and their pepperoni pizza",positive
"Toit has been one of my favorites when I have stop by for a lazy, good beer and some comfort sides",positive
"So well finally after so much of hype i decided to try To!t with my friends. But i NVR expected this will turn into a bad experience. The ambiance is super cool no doubt abt it. Drinks are little expensive but tats ok but the food is totally waste. We ordered peri peri cheese fries, andra chilli chicken, bbq chicken wings. But none of the food satisfied me or my friends. There are many pubs in that same surrounding wch serves low priced craft beers with great food and ambiance.",negative
"My friends and I visited the place. They had beer and I had a cocktail as I'm not a beer person. We had ordered three varieties of beer, i don't remember the names though but the Cocktail was Bacardi Mojito. For starters we had ordered Chicken Wings, Lemon Chicken and Onion rings. Totally loved the flavour of the Peri Peri Wings and the Lemon Chicken. For maian course we had ordered Pizza, don't remember the name but it was equally good..üòç",positive
"One of the best microbreweries I've been to. Love the vibe at this place. All the beers are good. The oktoberfest was one of the best lagers I've had. For appetisers I tried the Cajun Potato Wedges, Mac & Cheese balls and onion rings. Cajun Potato wedges were the right amount of crispy and tasted amazing too. Mac & Cheese balls were decent but wouldn't recommend the Onion rings. They were too oily and the coating on the onion rings kept falling off completely. Would recommend the toit full house pizza and the Tartufo. Limited options for Veg but Tartufo was a must try. For desserts I tried the layer cake which was rich and chocolaty, just the way I like it.",positive
Ellarigu Namaskara! It was a weekday that we have been a group of 5 around 5pm. The crowd was a bit less and they started coming in big numbers after 6pm. They have variety of craft beers with different sizes. Food prices were bit on higher side but it was tasty though. It‚Äôs very close to metro station so not to worry on connectivity. Ambience: 4.5/5 Price: 4/5 Service: 5/5 Food: 4/5 Overall a good place to hangout.,positive
"Nice full house bar with its own brewery. Generally crowded in weekends and very difficult to get entry. Brewed beers are worth trying and it taste awesome. Food is nice, ambience is great, staffs are friendly and polite, what else. Also price is very reasonable. Three floors are there with brewery at the bottom. I have been here couple of times and every time I just had a wonderful time. If you are planning to visit please do a pre-booking before you go for a pleasant experience.",positive
"Have been here more than twice. Such lit ambiance! Huge seating area. Great crowd! Beer üëå we had tried bullfrog- was a bit strong. Pizza was good, you can option for it if you like thin crust pizzas. Salads were so filling! VFM 4.5/5 Service 4/5 Food 4.5/5",positive

The decor is done well and spacious with both indoor and outdoor sitting arrangements with beautiful view . Simply loved the ambience As for the staff they are courteous .

"Went here on my birthday with office peeps! Absolutely loved the ambience. The place is very spacious with a huge seating area. We ordered veg nachos and Garden City pizza. They were decent enough for the price. Beer was a bit costly compared to other places in the area. The best part about the place was the super attentive staff. Especially Ranjit M who served us. He was very courteous and helped us a deal with the orders. Upon knowing that it was my birthday, he offered me a complimentary dessert which again, was super delicious. A must-visit if you're in JP Nagar!",positive
"Good open air ambience. Ample amount of seating. The service is very fast and the staff, especially Jacob and Milan, are very courteous. The food taste is good and so are the drinks. The portions can be made a bit more generous.",positive
"Specifically went to taste their much hyped pineapple beer, and I really liked the flavour, quite different and very refreshing..Whereas didn't like any other beers..The place is very big and quite popular for sunday brunch , it was almost full house..So if you're in and around JP nagar then you can plan a visit..",positive
Our server Pintu gave us impeccable service. Paid attention to our needs and took care of us very well. The food fell below par the pork ribs we‚Äôre extremely fatty and salty than normal given that visit here at least 5 times a month. The service made up for it.,positive
"One of the best pubs in Jp nagar.. Pub is usually not friendly for families here it's different We can kids and whole family in the pub. Ambience is really good. Food is decent. Brewed beer was good. I would recommend you to try Indian Pale Ale, Chicken ghee roast,Nimbu paneer. Ambience 5/5 Food 4/5",positive
Amazing ambience. Loved the brunch spread. The menu had literally everything starting from South to North and chats to antree to variety of main course. Unlimited beer + food for around 1.6 k. The Brew choices were amazing. Star attraction was Aakarsh the magician. Will love to visit here again.,positive
"Brahma brew works, you've definitely made it to my favorite list. Starting off with the ambience, enter and on the other side literally lies a different world. With ample space and different spots to hangout and water bodies in between, definitely doesn't feel like this is in Bangalore city area. Food part, the chicken ghee roast, damn it just melted off my mouth. The udon noodles is something that I've never tried before and it was too good! Their pork dishes are good too! The pizzas here are noteworthy too. Now the best part, desserts well the milkyway cake and baklava, are a must try. Not to forget the service, the staff here are very courteous and helpful!",positive

I have been to a lot of buffets but this place was actually different from the usual. They had some really hatke dishes for starters and for main course. Hardly you find crab and prawns or Udupi chicken wings sort of dishes in any other buffet places. This is one place worth trying. Great variety in both veg and nonveg. Checked Momos was something beyond the usual. I did not like the pizza and fish starter though.,positive
"A north Indian vegetarian writing this review. The experience here was good but not exceptional. The starters and desserts at this kind of places are the difference maker, unfortunately for a vegetarian there were very less varieties if we compare it with its competitors. The waiters doesn't attend you very properly because of the crowd but then it ruins the experience. Light going out for 5 minutes with no backup was again hilarious which you never expect.",negative
"I have really underestimated this place. I've never noticed this place as its less visible from the road and the entry is in the side of the building. My friends suggested this for a b'day treat. We booked via Zomato and received instant response. We were well received and well briefed on the current menu. Mr.Tony ensured we were served what we liked, no matter how many times. Must try is Fish Pollichadhu, chicken biriyani, Semiya Payasam, Dhal and Rice.. Never felt so satisfied for the price.. Will visit this place again.. keep it up guys!",positive
"Enjoyed buffet dinner there. Extremely polite staff, fast service. What I like the most there was, they have maintained the taste of the food even for buffet unlike many places getting on boarded to the buffet concepts. Enjoyed even the siders like papdi chat, momos and golgappe. Ice cream was really good also the main course. Overall taste, staff, food and ambiance, I felt everything was really awesome for the price that they charge.",positive
"Ambiance : The place is good. The seating arrangement needs improvement. Here 3 stars. Food: Starters: We went on Tuesday, we were served with Garlic Prawns, Chicken Wings and Sarso Fish wrapped in banana leaf. These three were tasted best. Prawns was too oily, but due to the taste factor here, we would give 4 stars. Main Course: Lot of improvement is required. The chef and the owner need to visit AB's, Black Pearl and have a meal to understand, how competitors are, so that they can change and fill in the blanks on the main course. We would give 2 stars. Deserts: Gulab Jamun was awesome. Rice Kheer and Semia was not cooked the way it should be . I never eat the pastries, they were looking great. Ice-cream was good, but Pan Shot will make it more better. Over all 3.",negative
"The Globe Grub claims have cuisines curated from around the globe. Though not completely accurate they do have some pretty decent variety of dishes. The starters and main course are on par with any other buffet outlets, if not better. But special mention for their selection of desserts and standard of taste they maintain.",positive
"Very tasty food . We went for a team lunch . Total value for money . Every dish was tasty and had a unique taste . Very crowded, definitely need prior booking. Would love to visit again . The buffet spread was hugh and exotic",positive
"I loved everything about this place , it's very close to all the offices located in that area so ultimately becomes the most preferable place for corporate lunch.

Love love love the pani puris!",positive

"I got one offer from dineout and wanted to check it out. Since it was fully booked in Marathahalli branch, I had to travel long to reach BTM branch. We were given a table as soon as we reach. Most of the starters were ok except mutton. In main course variety was good. Live grill was nice. They also serves rolled ice cream. Overall we liked the food",positive
Nice spread. Worth visiting.,positive
"We visited this place for a team lunch with corporate booking. The place is quite happening with a great ambience which tried to give a hint of greenery. This is quite spacious and sitting arrangements are also quite planned. The service is bit slow but good humble staff. Coming to the food, starters were yummy specially the fish and prawns. The soups and the dimsums were also tasty and also has a variety of salads. But I find the variety of starters were bit less as compared to it's Marathalli branch, 3-4 dishes were missing or was not served to us in starters. The main course and desert section was good with limited and good dishes. Overall a nice lunch experience.",positive
"The buffet spread is mouth-smackering delicious. You get the usual starters like Mutton Seekh Kebab, Prawn fry, etc you also get Pizzas as part of the offering. The fish starter they serve is brilliant. Service wise, the staff are polite and gracious and make a concerted effort to check whether the food served is satisfying your taste buds or not. The seating is spacious and the location of the restaurant is easy to find as it's on the main road. Price wise it's decent. A definite must try for any foodie out there.",positive
"Its a beautiful beautiful looking place just next to the vega city mall. The ambience of this place is very good.. not too quiet.. not too loud.. a perfect place to visit with family and friendsüëç The non veg starters included the prawns, which were yum as they should be, there was a perfectly cooked fish wrapped in banana leaf which just melts in the mouth and obviously chicken also which was cooked perfectly. Even the veg starters were yummy. The chat items tasted fresh, i could TAST the cleanliness in the chat quality.

"Many of my friends , people whom I know used to ask suggestions for best buffet places. . Now I have a clear answer is THE GLOBE GRUB. . Yes , it's one of those buffet places I came across which has a diverse range of options in food n beverages. Price ranging from 500 -800 varying in veg n non veg options. Excluding the drinks which I didn't liked it here the food is amazing. They have a live chat counter, dessert and pasta counter too. Yoo! Man their chats are amazing. Do try every chats here. You will love it. Desserts are too good. Both bakery and desi sweets. I would recommend this place for everyone.",positive

There are handful of places that offer biryani as star selling item and this place is on amongst it. Tried chicken chilly andhra style and mutton biryani. Biryani was nice and you don‚Äôt feel full. Light on spices and stomach,positive
"If you been visiting b'lore's pubs and restaurants, you must have heard Meghana's biryani. Well, the restaurant looks a little bit shady, and the waiters were also kind of busy on their own, but as soon as you take your first bite, you'll have this utterly delicious taste of andra masalas and soft juicy chicken which make you forget about the surrounding. I would insist you on going for 1 chicken biryani and 1 chicken side dish for 2 people. Trust me the portion is appropriate for 2 though they will suggest for for going 2 biryanis for 2 people.",positive
What a great experience we had. I visited this place with my friends and just loved the food here.the waiter was too friendly and kind to serve the food on time and hot,positive
"I orders chicken biryani through zomato, the biryani met my expectations. The quantity was sufficient for 2 persons. You could get the rich tastes of all the spices used in the biryani. The aroma was really mesmerising. I would definitely recommend this to people in Bangalore apart from the traditional biryani centres in and around Bangalore.",positive
Enjoyed some good andhra dum biriyani along with chicken butter masala. If i stayed in bangalore I'd come every weekend. Service is good too and it has a reasonable rate. 4/5,positive
"Meghana Biryani is famous all around Bangalore and they don't disappoint. I previously had been to their kormangala branch and loved it. So when a few friends suggested this, it was a no brainer! There are 2 floors with ample seating options. Since we went for lunch at 2am, the place was bursting with energy. There were so many waiters and servers running around. We ordered a paneer Biryani and a Meghna special Biryani. And a chicken kebab. Loved the kebabs and the paneer Biryani was good. Somehow we didn't really like the Meghna special chicken Biryani. Wish we had ordered the normal chicken Biryani instead. Anyway, it was ok. The Biryani was atomatic, hot and flavourful. And we didn't have to wait long. The servers were pretty quick with our orders. Good experience. Will visit again. Overall: Food: 4/5 Service: 5/5 Ambience: 3/5 Value for money: 4/5",positive
"Good place to have biryani in neighborhood. Always crowded. Cozy ambience. I did not like this place much. I had been here 3/4 times. 1st time we had chicken 65, naan, paneer. It was very spicy n full of chillies. 2nd time we had dum aloo biryani and chicken biryani. Quantity was so much. We could not even eat just bcz it was too spicy. Taste was not bad. Chilly prawn is very tasty. If u like spicy food u can try here. What I don't like about this restaurant is they put so much curry leaves and chilles in starters. Apart from that staffs were active, service was on time.",negative

The boneless chicken pieces were so moist and tender (too damn yummy man!). The aroma just crept into my nostrils to invite me for a devouring session. I would have given it 5 stars if it was more spicy; there was hardly any masala in it... But that's just a minor complaint. Overall, it was one of the best Biryanis I have had and would surely eat again when I visit Bengaluru the next time.",positive

"I've been to Daddy's a few times and the place has a great vibe to it. I personally prefer the outdoor seating, specially when you are going with a group of friends. Although their revolving bar indoors is also quite fancy. Loved everything we ordered - 1. Started with the Margherita Kulchas - I'm a fan of pesto and cheese and this had both as stuffings along with sun-dried tomatoes 2. Next were the ghee roast sliders..cute mini burgers with ghee roast which cannot go wrong 3. The chutney sheekh- a must try 4. Lebanese style kebab- my non-veggie lover friends polished it off in seconds. The pita and hummus with the kebabs was an effortless combination 5. And a plate of hot honey chilli potatoes with sesame goes perfectly with that mug of chilled beer üçª",positive

"Loved this place. What a great vibe in the almost dead Indiranagar now. The ambiance is absolutely beautiful and has its own originality in the sea of competition around. They have great seating, great music and actually great service. You would think the place is jam packed and you won't get enough attention, but you actually do. Food is decent (was dissapointed with the fries platter, rest were good enough) but drinks are great! Desserts were mostly unavailable when I had been there, the options looked appealing and i would love to go try those again. Crowd is good and i guess it is just a perfect place to go to either for a date or a get together or a catch up, you name it and you won't be dissapointed here. A little pricey though :)",positive

"Easily a great place to consider to hang out for good food and a chill ambiance. The pizzas are good sized and thin crust. The barbeque chicken has the right balance of sweet and savoury. Quesadilla is extremely cheesy , crumbles in your hands with the goodness of cheese and is extremely filling. Pasta was very mediocre. Fries with it's various choices of sauces, toppings and cheeses are extremely satisfying. Overall a must visit, but hopefully they'll get their pasta on track.

The seating arrangements include swings and hammocks and are worthy of instagramming. We had the pizza cups which were very good and buckwheat noodles which were weird.

The food and the quantity was impressive. A heads yo would be nice on the quantity of the pasta served especially for people with low appetite because the menu is a little on the costly end!

Visted the bessy outlet for lunch. Quite a nice place to hangout with friends. The seating is quite different here with swings n side seated benches. Coming to the food i loved the chicken steaks very much and was sooper good. The Cajun fries with cheddar cheese tasted good. The mozzarella cheese sticks with sambal was nice but was too heavy. The highly claimed chocolate pani poori was different n too sweet and also u get to choose ur poori stuff and milk shakes.,positive
"Visited on a rainy Wednesday evening, this place is located right next KFC Bessy. Ambience was cozy, Not a place to chill or relax as the place ain't that comfortable to dine. Service was good and Gold members can enjoy their 1+1 food. Ordered bbq wings, kalamari, teryaki speghatti and Baked fish.. Taste was Ok'ish not upto to the mark based on the reviews we saw..The sides what they gave for the starters was great though. Entree's was OK..Coming to the main course. Speghatti was too blant and spicy, baked fish was just fine..Ordered Oreo milkshake which was brilliant. Overall a one time visit restaurant which needs to focus on thier taste, and make the place much more comfortable to dine in..Expectations belied üòîüòî",negative
"The food taste was awesome, dessert could have been better. Rings of glory was too good, squid was fried very crispy and the masala added to it was perfect. The place is cozy and seats are little uncomfortable.",positive
I love their ambiance...this restaurant's seating arrangement was awesome..i love that swings and all..their billing style also different... This restaurant is not so pocket friendly...menu was nice.. chocolate pani puri also nice..,negative
"Visited this place as we were at Besant Nagar beach.. Cozy place with interesting interiors.. Ordered Pani puri shots and it's very good.. Also ordered nutella crepe.. It is okay. We would give 5* rating for their experimental pani puri shots and 4* for crepe and 5* for the interiors. As we were winding up a guy came to us with bill and started asking us feedback. As we were discussing with him our 1 year old slipped a glass tumbler and it broke. It is unfortunate that this accident happened but the restaurant owner / waiter who came asked us feedback is also equally responsible. As we were discussing with him, we couldn't keep an eye on our little one for a second and this happened. If he wasn't there, this wouldn't have happened. Also being a Cozy place, their tables are so small that something or other will fall down eventually anyways. They charged us 300 rupees for this!!!!!!! Seriously 300 for a glass?",negative
"I really like the ambience and the service at this place. The colorful decor and cozy seating along with the great presentation make it a complete place for a great outing. I‚Äôm a fan of the starters here and tried the quesadilla, cheese balls and fries. For the main course I tried the aglio olio pasta but I felt like it could be a little less extra on the flavours and more subtle. For the desserts I recommend trying out one of the signature dishes-chocolate pani Puri. Lots of interesting milkshake flavours and fillings.",positive
A good place to hang out with friends...!!! Chicken fries was yummy üòã Chocolate paani poori was too good not to miss...!!! ‚ô•Ô∏è Chicken wings tasted as usual...!!! Ambience is good but the place is too small Overall the name of this restaurant is very much relatable...!!! üòá,positive
"A place that serves great food but seating and tables HAVE to be improved. It was a sudden lunch plan and we decided to go to this place because we‚Äôve been wanting to. We ordered for Peri-Peri Fries with chipotle sauce, cheddar cheese and chicken cubes, Creamy Chicken Bunny Chow, Spicy Baked Fish with rice and a Green Apple Mojito. Everything tasted amazing, but the winner was the Bunny Chow! Super creamy and delicious! üòã But seriously, like I told you they need to improve on the seating. It‚Äôs all pretty to look at but the tables are really uncomfortable, seats are made out of wood - it‚Äôs a great theme that‚Äôs been executed poorly. Next time maybe I‚Äôll get a takeaway if the tables and seating stay the same.",positive
"I have tried this place twice and both are during cricket screening. They screen India and IPL matches on match days. During the first visit, I ordered a sandwich and a milkshake they suggested which we need to guess with what flavours they are made of. If I did that, I was told that I needn't pay for it. But sadly I failed! The sandwich was too good and the milkshake was delicious. 5/5! During the second visit, I ordered a plate of paneer pasta and a plate of fried with Caribbean masala. The fries were good - nothing much. But the pasta was perfect as we wanted a spicy one. We had also ordered a vanilla shake and a Nutella shake. Both were delicious. Enjoyed with friends, a cricket screening and completed with a beach walk in the bessie! Shakes are a must try here. Do visit on a match day!",positive
"So visited this place on one of the evenings after our beach visit to besant nagar. Small cozy place. And no fuss. Good service and good food. Tried the Rings of Glory (kalamari), which was crispy and seasoned well, along with cold coffee which had the perfect amount of sweetness for my liking and watermelon juice. I was extremely satisfied with the quantity of food served, since i am from Bangalore and it's a different scenario esp for calamari and the portion served here.",positive
"The Best Food is offered here. The people are so kind and helpful at Blind Ch3mistry. Awesomatic Ambience and if you need privacy you can choose such seating which they offer. Price is little high but worth for the Quality, Quantity, service and Ambience. We had 1. Watermelon cooler - Bestest ever 2. Peri Peri Fries with Mixed Cheese - Loved it 3. Corn Cheese Balls - Cheesiest inner and crispier outside at its highest. 4. Veg Creamy Pasta in white sauce with crunchy vegetables was fantastic. On the whole you need to visit it. Which was Sufficient for 3 people. Do visit.",positive
A perfect hangout place with possibly one of the best ambience I've been in. The food is really good and the cost to quality ratio is quite satisfactory. *FREQUENTLY VISITABLE*,positive
"I chose the Zen Den seating here as I was with a friend and just wanted to have a good conversation. They've got many other seating arrangements depending on the number of people you're with and what occasion you're celebrating. The fact that you can literally design everything that goes into your fries is really cool and that's what we ended up doing! Any combination you go with will turn 9utnto he good. Their Nacho Pizza chicken is also very, very good! Since we weren't too hungry, we just did starters and desserts. For dessert we had brownies. They were pretty ordinary. They can make their desserts better. All in all, I really like the concept but imo, the place is a tad overrated, but good.",positive
"My friends and me were looking for something to eat around this area and we choose Blind Chemistry. Ambiance is playful and quirky. We ordered the Crispy Chicken, Crispy paneer and French fries which were good. For drinks we had the kit kat shake, salted caramel shake which did not have any caramel taste and red velvet that tasted like plain strawberry. For main I ordered creamy pasta upon waiting for 30 mins I had not received my food and it was time for closing. The sever has forgotten to order. It was too late for me to finish the dish which was a disappointment.",negative
"Updating my review after being a regular here. The ambience is fantastic, they have a setting for every mood. The seating is very comfortable. The food is delicious! And the taste is consistent. The fries are a must try. The staff is very friendly. I once sat at a different table for every dish to try the ambience and they warmly encouraged it. Special mention to Henry! He is the most thoughtful waiter. Always ensures the temperature is comfortable, the water is filled and you are comfortable, all the while being invisible.",positive

A really good place to have scrumptious meal with your family and friends. Visited this place for a team dinner and enjoyed our time here. The veg buffet had a lot of options and the taste was good as well. The service was a bit slow but that is because it was a house full show. What really disappointed me was the mocktails and the music. The mocktails were over sweetened and lacked real flavors also the oreo shake was not upto the mark. Live music was just average. Overall a good place to enjoy the buffet. My Ratings :- Food - 4 Ambiance - 4.5 Service - 4 Value for money - 4 Overall - 4 Happy Fooding :),positive
"Decent food and well designed decor, Suman and karim were tending to our table and we're very helpful.

Mocktails - Had the one with sugarcane, quite good! Desserts - Decent! Only comment I have is that the plates and cutlery weren't cleaned well, there were grease stains and dried spots - which shouldn't be there in a higher end place like this.",positive

Brilliant staff, fresh team and very energetic, yes friendly too. I have ordered for a pizza, it was lovely and true thin crust. Perfect music, loud and it's perfect set. The ambience was truly way beyond my expectation. All the aspects i like this place. My recommendation please give a try this place all the energetic weekend people. Thank you. We will visit again...",positive
"Excellent ambience, tasty food with roof top option. Definitely one of the roof top restaurants in Chennai. It can be the best place to party if alcohol was served. Staff were kind and courteous.",positive
"Right at the heart of Sholinganallur above the Pirate themed restaurant Black Pearl. The view and the ambience is awesome. The breeze will make you feel like you're very close to sea. The lights, interiors and outdoor setting are done well. Ordered murgh methi malai (not so sweet), hogger's delight and chilli garlic noodles. All served fresh n hot. There were more workers than customers and still they were soo confused who ordered what. Can't ignore the fact that they were very hospitable. Ambience - 5/5 Taste - 4/5 Service - 3/5 VFM - 3/5",positive
"The place is spot on in its ambience. Perhaps the best that i have seen in Chennai. Excellent location. Right at the Shollinganallur junction. The rooftop traffic view of Shollinganallur trafic is worth a view. The cool sea breeze at rooftop is just refreshing. Excellent service. Polite waitors and receptionist. The only place where this place deserves one star less is the food taste. It needs improvement. Its not bad, but not exceptional too. Its above average, I would say. The place is betting big on serving liquor and making this place the best place to hangout on a weekend, but it would fail miserably if the food taste is not improved further. I will definitely come back again and change my review if the one thing about food taste gets improved",positive
Newly opened restaurant üìçOMR @looprooftoploungeandkitchen One of the biggest rooftop lounge in Chennai ‚ô•Ô∏è Thr ambience is top notch with great music. ‚≠ê With kind gesture staffs and authentic presentation of food !! One must definitely visit the place. PS: Alchocol service is yet to begin.,positive
"I was waiting for a really long time to hang out here. Located just right to the Sholinganallur signal right above black pearl. Right from the entrance to the roof top everything will soothe your eyes and the kind gesture of the staffs tops all. We ordered paneer tikka pizza and should I say that it‚Äôs one of the best I have had so far with the thin crust and the intact moisture, and it‚Äôs been days since I have been there still I long for their PALLIPALAYAM CHICKEN guys that is to die for with special authentic spices and the dried coconut perfectly cooked boneless tender chicken is my favourite. And to finish it we had walnut brownie with ice cream, it was so beautifully presented and the brownie was so spongy and wet and was so perfect to end. There is a fifty percent offer going on since they are new so wish you could go and use them right away.",positive
"A great restaurant to take your special one on a date. Chennai has very few scenic rooftops like this. The view is mesmerising. The bright decor of the place lifts the spirits. The stuffed mushrooms with herbs are divine and definately a must try. Panko crusted fish were just the right amount of spicy and they come with some pickled veggies in the side that gives it a great twist. If you like tangy do not miss the mango shake with Chaat masala. We had subz Briyani which was amazing. The service is something we would keep coming back for. Very prompt and attentive service by Mr Siddhu, he gave us an honest guidance and was very hospitable. Ambience 5/5 Food 4.5/5 Service 6/5",positive
Omg finally Chennai people are found a place where people are got everything. It is South India's biggest rooftop bar & lounge. Awesome location One of the best places to get modern food.it has unique and authentic presentation.it is something new to experiment. I would recommend you'll to visit this restaurant and make sure you sit outdoors. Great staff and they are very friendly. This place is a must visit place... Dj was one of the best dj with huge display. Cheers Loop!!!,positive

"Lovely food and courteous staff....fried ice cream chocolate flavor was the bomb....ordered Thai chilie prawns ,chicken and chives dim sum , grilled beef salad and the Singapore chicken rice.....loved them all.....",positive
"Food as you‚Äôd get in a Kopitiam in Malaysia and Singapore and Indonesia, upmarket prices given location, spacious interiors and courteous staff make for a 5 on 5. The taste is exceptional and while the portions aren‚Äôt that generous I‚Äôd recommend a visit or two or three :) purely for the gastronomically delightful experience. Try the soup dumplings, Tom yum soup, hor fun, lotus stems, crispy corn and of course nasi goreng, mee goreng and nasi lemak Parking is an issue.",positive
"Such a beautiful restaurant located at the bustling knk road, the ambience is great. But it‚Äôs packed on weekends also the tables are close to each other so there‚Äôs no privacy. Coming to the food, we ordered honey chilli lotus stem for starters and nasi goreng chicken, hunan veg fried rice for mains and tofu satay as a side dish. Nasi goreng was topped with egg and came along with 2 pcs of chicken satay, it tasted amazing. Tofu satay was good but the peanut dip it came along was bad. Also the hunan veg fried rice had a lot of ginger flavour in it making it difficult to eat. I‚Äôve had better hunan fried rice at Many places. Service was very good and quick. The bill was 1600 for these items. They do deliver a service charge of 10 percent.",positive
"The grilled beef salad was an absolute taste explosion! Really well done and I would go back just to eat this. The laksa was everything it should be - warm, comforting and coconutty. Very enjoyable meal!",positive
Oh this place! I tell you this is absolutely an amazing place to be in if you love food. Nasi Goreng is the dish to die for... I repeated my order and had the second serve all alone... Trust me it was that yum!,positive
"Had been wanting to go here for a long time .The place was pretty crowded since it was late when we reached but still loved the ambience and the service they provided.Starting with the soup,we had ordered the veg Tom yum soup which was perfect because my dad was feeling feverish and this was very soothing , I tired the salmon sushi, it was my first sushi experience and I did like it. I wanted to try their Milo drink because I ahd heard many positive reviews on it but then I ordered the chendal drink which was very very good and has become one ofy favorites,If your a coconut milk and jaggery lover ,you will surely like it.We also had the beef salad,Malaysian chicken satay and egg garlic butter fried rice which were all equally good. For deserts we had the lychee icecream and the Milo Pannacota ,which were both nice. Will definitely try their iced Milo drink next time and their chocolate dumplings",positive
"I've been here before and I really like this place. So we ordered Milo and Chendol for drinks. Loved em both! Coming to the food, we had Szechuan chilli dumpling, Che chow, Crispy avocado sushi, honey chilli lotus stems, Nasi and Mee curry noodles (not in picture) and XO noodle soup (not in picture). We really enjoyed all of it except the crispy avocado sushi - it was good but not to our liking.",positive
"Authentic Oriental cuisine with absolutely courteous staff.. Chicken wintermelon soup, sch.chilly dumpling, mapo tofu Jasmine rice, lemak coconut infused rice, panda bao, and Chinese tea.. could feel authenticity in every bite...",positive
"WOW! The quality of the food here is just like what I have eaten in KL. We didn't try the Milo (had a lot of it in KL :) ) Starters we tried the Pandan Chicken Satay. Loved Pandan flavour cakes in KL so decided to try it out. This didn't have much of the Pandan taste but if was very juicy. For mains, we tried 2 things. Nasi Lemak was WOW. Highly recommended! The flavors were spot on. Singaporean Chicken and Rice. This is one of the go-to foods to eat. Try the steam chicken, brings out the blandness in the food. Loved it! If I lived in Chennai, I'd probably eat here every week!",positive
Ambience minimum Service super fast Food great Had the chilli lemon soup which was simply superb.The lotus stem and the crisp avocado sushi as starters where great.The nasi goreng was nice an is a meal for two.A special mention to the super fast service.

"I travelled all the way from kodambakkam to alandur just for sukkubhai because I couldn't wait any to try their biriyani.. Heard lot of positive and negative comments about their biriyani, so I couldn't wait to try and review about it truly. If you missing any chennai's Muslim wedding biriyani then this place is the PLACE to crash in.. Not spicy but yet the flavours match the taste buds perfectly. Pocket friendly!! Quick service. I couldn't ask for more. *FYI - Mutton biriyani was better than chicken AND Please chuck the ambience, who cares about it if the food is good right?!",positive
Ohh yes finally had the sukkubhai biryani and it was totally worth. The spice and the taste was just perfect . Its was worth for everything. Must give a try ü§§. Ordered 1/2 chicken biryani √ó2 and 1/4 chicken biryani and mint lemonade drink which was unique though . 1/2 chicken biryani costed 140 per plate and 1/4 chicken biryani costed 80rs. Overall costed around 540. Which was decent. #sukkubhaibiryani,positive
"I stood in a queue for 2 hours on Ramzaan to get a parcel of beef biriyani and beef fry. Honestly, I felt that the biriyani could have been better but the beef fry was really good, no doubts about that. I felt that there could be a little more flavor to the biriyani or it could be just my personal preference. Overall, I would say this place is definitely worth a visit just to check out the crazy crowd that it generates every day at lunchtime.",positive
"Have been craving to try biriyani from this place, we went on a Sunday for lunch,it was packed and there huge queue for take away and online orders. After waiting for 15 minutes we got the seat. Ordered Beef and Chicken biriyani boy-o-boy it was all worth the wait. Beef was cooked nicely and juicy. Must try for Biriyani lovers Ambience : 3.5 Quality : 4.5 Quantity : 4.5 Service : 4.5 Cost : 4 Big üëçüëç",positive

Wanna try beef Biriyani? One of the best place to try is here! Must try here! Ambience is good! Service was also good! It‚Äôs affordable. Beef cutlet is yummy! With the onion toppings on it! They serve with rahitha and brinjal salad along with some sweet after the meal! So good!,positive
"I have been 2 times to Sukkubhai so far. Went once on a late night and ended up not getting a plate of mutton Biryani. I got chicken biriyani but it was a bit soggy. Can't complain on a late night. The sweet was good though. The second went on a Saturday noon and a bit packed crowd was found. We ordered chicken combo. Came a plate of biriyani, Parotta, Chicken boneless, chicken 65, gravy and sweet. Biriyani was good and chicken boneless was perfect. Parotta was heavy but really good. VFM for 220 rs.",positive
"Impressive, A long desire cherish the taste of tender beef pieces in biryani, no wonder sukkubhai biryani treats you with softness and good quality biriyani. Ambience is well Maintained with friendly staff members. üêÇBeef biryani stands good compared with other shops,right proportion of masala and well cooked rice makes it wonder. Parotta with üêëmutton gravy is an good combo worth a try. Beef cutlet are well cooked and fried neatly. Ambience -4/5 Good 4.5/5 Price-4.5/5 Parking spaces is also available.",positive
Chicken briyani was gud n tasty,positive
Such an amazing place and the food is so good here. Right from their service till the food everything is just so perfect. And the best person here to assist you is Mr. Karma. So now you know whom to contact when you are here. Keep up the good work.,positive
"This is a fine fine places that serves good food. They have tried to give the feel of a dhaba by doing interiors and choosing cutlery appropriately. All the dishes we ordered were good. Only part that needs improvement is the service. Too many people come to help you and when it comes to Zomato gold related matter, they look at you with such skeptical eyes and seem to be very insecure about customers using gold. They accept gold but ask too many questions and keep coming to table to try to alter your order. This really needs improvement.",positive
"In terms of songs being played and decor, yes it gets it. Especially in Chennai. Service is also pretty quick. Food though was a mixed bag. In starters Tawa Mutton was excellently cooked, but Bhatti Da Tangdi wasn't juicy. It was on drier side. Mushroom hara pyaza was par for the course. Soup of the day was tomato soup. And masala papad was there too. Both were average. But Rajdhani Jal Jeera was really really tangy and yummy. By the time, we reached mains, we were quite full, so we only ordered Dal Dhaba and Indian flat breads. Dal was delicious. In desserts we ordered Dhaba Ka meetha which was a layered dessert made of ice-cream, gulab jamun, rabdi etc. This was heavenly. Overall, a decent experience.",positive
"It was really a nice experience in this place. We ordered nargisi seekh kebab, with the obvious choice 1986 butter chicken , butter naan and amritsari kulcha. All were tasty and mouth watering. Service was good and Karma was really courtious with a smile. Loved the experience. Surely coming up back.",positive
"One of the best Dhabas I have visited within the city. The ambience is top notch and quite a surprise for a place within Ispahani, which is pretty much a dead spot unless you are in college. But with places like Dhaba Estd 1986 Delhi, I am proven fatally wrong. We sat behind the front of a truck on the top most floor. I am wondering how they got it there in the first place. The food we ordered included Masala Papad, Garlic Naan, Malai Chicken, Balti Special. Sweet as well as Salted Lassi. The food was amazing. The naan and the Balti mutton were perfect. They need to be careful with the lassi, we did find a bit of plastic in it. They were gracious in accepting their mistake and this showed even in the bill. For desserts, we had Rabdi, Badam Halwa and Gulab Jamun. All of it were amazing. Will be visiting this place again soon.",positive
"I visited this restaurant twice for lunch. One time I tried roti, curry and starter nd the other time I ordered briyani and a starter. Restaurant is neatly done. Some seating is not good. Waiters are attentive. Taste is excellent. I will definitely recommend this place. Price is slightly higher, but the place is really good. I would visit again and recommend this place.",positive
"Heard a lot of rave reviews about this place so decided to check it out! The ambience is cozy, with dhaba decor around the place. Full points for that. Coming to the food, we went for Lal Mirch Ka Paneer tikka as starter. HUGE SHOUTOUT! The paneer was perfectly juicy and soft and so well marinated, we wanted more and more. Being a roasted papad fan, we tried that too. It was well spiced and good. Now onto the mains, we went for the Subz Patiala and tandoori rotis. The subzi was fresh, and had a unique taste to it. Highly recommended! Now comes the disappointment, we craved for Kubani ka Meetha. The dish didn‚Äôt taste like how it was supposed to, and we also found a piece of plastic in our dessert. We informed the manager and he waived it off the bill since we didn‚Äôt want a replacement. Overall, a good dhaba food fare. I‚Äôm not quite sure if it is worth the money.",positive
"It's a great North Indian cuisine restaurant. I loved the ambience and the service. I had vegetarian food which was tasty. The lassi is a must try ü§© I had Matar Paneer, Dal Tadka, Biryani, Kulcha and Paratha. All of them were yummm.",positive
"Shout out loud, ""Best Punjabi Restaurant in Chennai."" Authentic Punjabi and every item we ordered were well cooked and best in their taste. Our order: Tandoori Bhune Aloo : Basically Aloo pakoda, ‚Çπ349 is expensive for aloo but it was yummy. Amritsari Kukkad : Tender boneless spicy chicken starter, just don't miss this one. Dal Dhaba : is Dal Makhani with makkhan marke and its authentic, because not every resturant can make an asli daal makhni. Kadhai Paneer : it was good but it can be better. Tandoori Roti, Garlic Naan, Garlic Tomato Cheese Naan, Amritsari Kulcha : all were good, best was Garlic Naan Desserts Gulab Jamun with ice cream : Good Rasmalai : Good Matka Kulfi : Excellent, with lots of khoya and pista, almonds.

Whats not to love something coming from mumbai. Great courteous staff. Explaining every dish. Best part you get small quantities also if your just 2 people. Dish to order: Pav bhaji fondue Galouti kebab Soya keema roti Rotis are good For 2 people if you take small quantity of galouti and pav bhaji will be 1000. Great team. Otherwise close to 1500 for 3 people. #nonsponsored #mumbai,positive

"A perfect place for vegetarians to have a sophisticated fancy meal with a gastronomic affair. Presentation and taste wise, I would definitely recommend this place and it‚Äôs perfectly centrally located too. I tried their Malai lassi, pav bhaji fondue, cheese naan, coconut water with assorted caviar, galouti kebab, vada paav and bubbling kulfi. Loved all of them and my personal favourite with no doubt remains the bubbling kulfi.",positive
"1) Kokkum margherita with chilli caviar 2) Mango on the rocks 3) Cheese pappad 4) Pav bhaji fondue 5) Naanzza 6) Flower pot Kokkum margherita is a sweet and sour drink, packs a punch.

The standard of the restaurant is high and quality of the food is unique and tasty. Tried the Malabar chicken biriyani and the biriyani is very flavourful and spicy and as a unique taste from the dum biriyani. Very fresh and tender chicken pieces used. The second time ordered Prawn Tom Yum Soup and Prawn Biriyani. Very high quality and tasty. The third time ordered squid pepper fry and the preparation and quality of the squid is amazing and tasty.

"A great desi cuisine! Nenjelumbu soup which is made of mutton ribs. This is a good desi medicine in village for common cold. I tried this because I had cold on that day. Which was very good. I had drumstick chicken as a starter, it was chef‚Äôs special and tasted amazing. I can feel the drumstick‚Äôs flavour in the chicken and it‚Äôs not weird at all. I went there especially for kizhi parotta - 2 parotta layers and chicken gravy in between with chicken 65 toppings and cooked in banana leaf. It tasted very different and yummy too! Usilampatti mutton curry was rich in flavour and aroma. I loved it. Mutton curry which people make in particular region. Fried ice cream and lemon mint cooler Small vanilla balls are deep fried with grated coconut coating. The coconut coating didn‚Äôt went well with this. Overall a good desi cuisine to try!",positive
It's an very unique place with lots of variety's . Presentation of food is good only thing I hate is the people who working there thay not giving proper service other than that all good !! Treat your taste buds ü•∞üòçü•∞,positive
"So the thing i absolutely love about this place is the ambience. The restaurant has a very nice lighting and is quite quiet :p. Perfect place to spend quality time and have some delicious food. Service is also pretty good. So we tried Mutton biryani which was very okayish. Mutton pieces were succulent and good, however the biryani was mediocre. The chef special chicken biryani was again decent, nothing great. The chicken lollipop was amazing here..! They also serve it with a garlic sauce which tastes fab along with the chicken lollipop. They have a wide range of food to try, will visit again to try the other dishes here surely..! :)",positive
"Copper Kitchen has always been one of my go-to places when I‚Äôve wanted to have a quick meal and scoot. Food is served fast, good taste, meat‚Äôs cooked well and good varieties on the menu. So I went to this new branch recently, and just as I expected - good food, decent ambience! We ordered for Chapatis, Naan, Barbecue Chicken and Chettinad Chicken gravy. Barbecue Chicken was hands down the winner, mainly cuz the meat was cooked so well, with good flavors. Chettinad Chicken gravy was decent, no complaints and the others were okay too. The place could‚Äôve been maintained well I felt. Especially the cleaning part.",positive

The service at this restaurant is truly one of the best I have ever seen. The place is huge and can host a lot of people but the staff handled all of them like a champ. The food has a decent spread and there were quite a few choices for the vegetarians as well. Another first timer was that the place had a good spread of main dishes as well. The special coal barbeque biscuits are definitely fun and worth trying out. A place worth considering provided you live around the IT expressway in Shollinganallur.,positive
"Been here during their stint of global street food festival. I was really fascinated by their inclusions in the menu as a part of the festival. There were too many to even number it, but on the outset one word to sum it all up would be this, 'authentic '.A very nice attempt. The team was really humble and very hospitable, hands down one of the best customer experience. Would like make a honorary mention of Mr.satish nair the manager and Mr.sartaj who've made the experience really exciting.",positive
They have introduced some new Purattasi maasam special veg options from coal barbecues.... Everything we had was great.... And this branch from navalur is the best coal barbeques I ever visited...

Coal barbecues is best for unlimited BBQ food. It serves very good starters compared to other BBQ places and the most promising is the dessert section. You will melt with the dessert menu they serve. It's a huge place and very good service Food 5/5 Ambience 5/5 Service 4.5/5,positive

Coal BBQ !!!! Good Place to hangout with Family / Friends !!! They have enough number of positive ratings already.. Just a suggestion to bring in New Items into Buffet so we won't find everything repetitive,positive
"An amazing place, suberb ambience excellent service. We had vegetarian buffet. Starters all of them were awesome, main course lacked in every dept absolutely horrible but desserts made up for the lousy main course. So many live counters. There's live counter for chat, pizza, nachos, fires, Mongolian rice and noodles. Chef sadam was very helpful in arrangements for Dal as they didn't have one on menu that day. Best part on request they get everything on table like sit down buffet. Didn't like Pani Puri it was pathetic. And rasmalai it was very bad. Pasta and schzewan noodles wasn't upto the mark. All the gravy were pretty much below average. Try to have fresh and hot waffle and donot awesome it taste straight from pan to plate. Taste:- 1/5 for maincouse 5/5 for starters and desserts. Ambiance:- 5/5 Price:- 4/5 Quality:- 4/5 Service- 5/5 Overall good experience definitely must try place. Would rate this place at 3.5/5",negative
There is always this hype tat this place is phenomenal n amazing and sooo i went to try dis place a weeek ago. The problem i found wid this place is the service is not as welcomin as in the other barbeque nation and there weree plenty of dish but i couldnt feel the satisfaction of having one dish in fulfilment. It was bits n pieces and not full contentment. But overall its worth for the money.,positive
"Location - located in Bazullah Road in tnagar along a stretch of busy restaurants. Parking - Ample space for parking is available. Food - the spread is huge. On the table starters included fish tikka, chicken tikka, prawns, Mutton - tasted so good. Also they have popcorn, and chat items that get served on table. And I loved the live grill counter where I had a mix of squid, duck, quails, and chicken. Their dessert spread is awesome with hot Jelabi, gulab jamun, chocolate fountain, and the pastry items. The finishing highlight is the fire paan which everyone really loved. A nice experience to finish the buffet. Pricing - dinner costs 700 on Monday and Tuesday. And 800 on other days. It's in par with other buffet restaurants. Service - was quick and courteous. Also they allowed us to stay a little Time more than the buffet time as we started late. Ambience - was perfectly lit and large in space. But the dessert areas felt over crowded and congested at times.",positive
A spacious bbq found in the city.A group of 10 people have visited there.such a good place and we have experienced all the variety and fire pan and smoke biscuit.and they have a number of live counters.,positive

We highly reccomend the murungai soup thats spicy and different from usual order. The chicken meshwi is crisp tender and delectable. Baby corn fingers were an instant hit with small children. As usual palm shore briyani is just the right balance of flavoured basmati rice and tender mutton pieces. We ordered a sizzling brownie for desert that disappeared so soon that I couldn't capture here. A great restaurant for family dinners",positive

But there are multiple type of preparations.... And the portion serving is very very generous... We had to ask 2-3 times if it was a single or multiple serving size.... The food is decent...

A decent visit which ensures you are well fed... Happy eating!!!",positive

"From the first time, I've had Mandi at Palmshore, I've always liked it. Having it directly as soon as it's served is much much better than ordering it through delivery partners or takeaway. But, I'd decided I'll write about it only after having tasted their Mutton Raan Mandi (‚Çπ1390) for which I needed more hands (or should I say mouths üòÅ). The opportunity came and 4 of us friends landed up at Palmshore and ordered their Mutton Raan Mandi. Mandi here never disappoints neither did it this time. Perfectly Masalafied and Grilled leg of a lamb with falling-off-the bone type meat just melted in the mouth. One can get addicted to this, seriously. And, the mandi rice carried perfect flavours, with very less irritants here and there like peppercorns or pickled lime. Love.... love... loved the Mandi. Totally Yummm!! It takes 30 minutes minimum to be served after placing the order. While waiting for the Mandi ordered Hummus (‚Çπ125) and Lime Mint Cooler (‚Çπ65). Totally paid ‚Çπ1727.",positive
"A Non - Vegetarian's paradise which is affordable. Parking is available. This restaurant is Highly noticeable and hard to miss. Had some bbq fish, Biryani and Goat leg soup. The soup brought tears to my eyes, not that it was too spicy, but it was too brilliant. Biryani was meh. Fish - Best fish I've ever tasted in Chennai! Finished off with a sizzling brownie which was kinda okay Food - 4.8/5 VFM - 4.5/5 Ambience - 4/5",positive
The food is good and the ambience is very cozy.,positive
A tiny and modern looking restaurant serving delicious Middle Eastern authentic food. Go here if you want to try something different and are ready to experiment. Things I loved were 1. Chicken lahmajoun (5/5) - Turkish thin crust flat bread with chicken and veggie toppings . Yummy to the core and doesn‚Äôt make you feel bloated( crispy and yummy flat bread) 2. Hummus (4/5) - comes with 1 pita bread. Authentic hummus taste. Was yumm. Service is excellent and fast and the restaurant is easy on pocket. People who enjoy Turkish delight should must visit .,positive
"I went to mezze to give a treat to my friends on my birthday. We ordered a lot of food. I had falafel platter, Sapanakopita, shakshuka, fish harissa, baklava, dukkha mushroom. My chicken loving friends went for harissa chicken and roasted chicken. I was a little disappointed that baba ganoush was unavailable. The harissa sauce fish is an absolute favourite, a melt in the mouth. All the drinks were average except the lemongrass which was extremely good. The falafel was disapointing and there was nothing great about the spanakopita. Every other dish we ordered was delicious with nicely balanced flavours.",positive
"Great authentic middle eastern food. French fries are well cooked, not so salty or oily. Chicken is also well cooked and juicy with the well expected flavors and spices added to suit the indian taste buds. Perfect location to hang out with friends be it a casual dining or for a birthday party. Slightly expensive but the taste is worth it.",positive
"This is my first time to where i have tasted the mid east food, to say about food it was good and was very different from another cuisine. The humma dip was different and the falalel balls stuffed with olives tasted very good and the chick pea fritters served with pita bread was really good and finally to say, the ambience and service was pretty well.",positive
"Me and friend went for a dinner here. Among cold mezzes, had Ordered for a labna and chilli garlic pita. The labna was more sour than what i had expected. Did not like it much! Then ordered one chicken shawarma and shish taouk. Both were very average according to me. For dessert, had ordered for a chocolate ganache which was amazing!! Overall, i did not enjoy the food at although my friend loved the food. Will visit again to try the other things on the menu! Edit 1: visited again and I must say I loved the food! The place is a little noisy since the room is small and it is always crowded with people. But the food was great this time. Had ordered for harissa chicken and almond kibbeh with extra cheese chili pita bread. Also ordered crispy lamb hummus. Every dish tasted absolutely delicious. The meat balls were amazingly juicy and had great flavours. The hummus too was very fresh and tasted out of the world. Definitely visiting again!",positive

"One of my favorite biryani places in Chennai has opened up a new branch with amazing ambience too! With the amazing decor and delicious food, Nivi's kitchen proves it strives to get better. In my recent visit I had obviously tried their authentic Hyderabad chicken biryani and chilli chicken. Which was really good and flavourful. This has been my go to dish in their Egattur branch too. The grilled chicken served with mayo is also a must try! The staffs here are really helpful and serve at the quick pace. Overall a peaceful place to dine in with good food. The prices are pretty nominal and it's a must try place for any one in the neighborhood! Looking to comeback soon!",positive
"Of my entire stay at Citadines, I've had amazing food from this restaurant whether via room service or direct dine in... Kudos to the amazing service and great quality of food... The one that I've ordered the most is #achari_fish_tikka and it was worth it... They have good continental spread in the menu as well...",positive
We tried this place because it was near the office and guess what they didn't disappoint at all. The ambience is very attractive and you would like to visit this place the second time even without tasting it's food. We ordered american pesto chicken pizza and BBQ chicken pizza. Both of them were thin crust and we'll enough for four people because of it's size. They tasted perfectly and had ample amount of cheese üßÄ. The levy 7% extra service charge but it was worth it they pay attention to all the needs of a customer. Service done by Vijaya Kumar. VFM: 5/5 Service: 5/5 Ambience: 5/5,positive
"A stylish place for brunch with your besties. They serve some delicious kebabs. We chose the classic chicken tikka with green mint chutney that was spicy, fiery red and tangy with crispy and juicy chicken cubes. For main course we ordered the chicken staganhoff with flavoured rice. The cream of the the straganhoff was so creamy and melts in your mouth. This is a very heavy dish don't judge it by the portion size. The virgin mojito was too salty for my taste and not something I would order again. The ambience and service is top notch. We had a delightful time without anyone hovering about your neck and asking you to leave. They have a lunch buffet too if you are in the mood for gluttony.",positive
"We were hunting for a restaurant in OMR and ended up going to Hola the other day. I am not a great fan of continental or mexican food, but however decided to have them that day. The restaurant is located centrally near the Sholinganallur junction. The ambience is good and the service is decent. The restaurant offered both buffet and a-la-carte services for lunch. We decided to take both (a couple of us went for buffer and the rest did not). The buffet (which I did not opt for) was sumptuous and good based on what my other friends who tried it opined. I went for Cheese Nachos for the starters and Veg Burrito for the main course. Like I said not being a great fan of that cuisine I found them to be just ok. Overall a nice restaurant for those looking for a continental/ mexican cuisine. Good quality food and nice dining experience.",positive

"There were a lot of items including live pasta items, but in the main coarse there was biriyani and chicken side dish North Indian preparations, the taste was not so good. There was also ham burger and lots of desserts options. I would specially like to take the name of Mr Nibras was really helped us in taking the desserts since it was 3pm and they were starting to close the desserts counter. A complimentary Cake was given to me as it was my Birthday celebration. Considering the price range it's worth a visit in this 5 start restaurant for buffet. But booking for a particular day has to be done 2 days before alse u will not reservation. Overall I would like to give 4/5 in ratings. Would like to visit the Restaurant in dinner for buffet",positive
"I finally got the opportunity to go to JW kitchen and the experience was good (not the best). The staff was polite and JW being JW the place was crowded even in a Friday afternoon. There are plenty of food to choose from, the papri chat, Biryani, Mutton, Chicken Kebab, Goan Fish curry were brilliant. However i was a little dissapointed with the desserts :( Overall it was a good experience, will come again soon.",positive
"Went for lunch today. Every dishes were delicious except the pasta. So many options starting from bread and salad to live pasta section. Dishes were fresh, worm and ofcourse well cooked . The dessert section will make you go crazy specially the bengali desserts. We choose the regular water which was filled with white water (didn't expect that on restaurant like this). Next time will go for the packet water . I'm looking forward to visit this place soon. Thank you! üòä",positive
"My experience was good in JW Marriott. Went there on a Tuesday lunch (quite crowded for a Tuesday). Was greeted politely and mentioned the booking through Zomato. They assured us to our table and then the buffet began. The starters were all too good. Taste wise and quantity wise. The sadal section suprised me the most. Almost half of it was new for me and all the salads were fresh and well prepared. The main course was also good combined with side dishes. Especially the mutton. The sweets were also available in different variety including waffles and icecream. If you are searching for a quality buffet, this is it. Recommended. The chat section was okay but felt a bit off from the usual taste of the dish. But if you are looking for variety over quality then you can try other places.",positive
Wanna have a fancy date ... Wanna a unlimited food too.. Then here you go . A place you cant miss,positive
"I loved the food, the biriyani, the mushroom, the mutton everything tasted delicious. The gracious staff added to the beautiful experience. Everything was great !! Though there were only 4 options for the starters, there was a whole table full of salami, ham, salads, and what not !!! The main course had veg and chicken biriyani, with mutton and paneer, and echor er dalna, thai chicken curry, plain rice, and so many items to choose from. The dessert section was a world of wonder in itself!! Although I would've loved to get some marshmallows as well (the jar was covered with plastic üòÖ).. The dessert couldn't fit in my stomach cz I was already full from the sumptuous main course.",positive
this royal luxurious place needs no introduction as its JW Marriot afterall... the buffet of this place will surely leave a mark on your memory lane for eternity..to know more watch the video by Debojyoti Vlogs on Youtube,positive
"Well what to write about this place..Nothing can go wrong as if when you're planning to go for fine dine in and end up booking JW..Right from super courteous staff to exotic ambience to humongous buffet menu..Everything is perfect there were so many items that I could not even remember the names of the dishes..But what I found show stopper is their dessert corner it's simply awesome never tasted so delicious Mihidana before and each every cake was unique and yumm in taste..And also loved their live counter where u can choose the fish and ask to fry it..Also loved the salad corner ..never knew salmon n avocado could taste this better .. As we went for Sunday brunch , the buffet cause around 1800 for one person..This might sounds costly but considering the variety they are offering is totally justified.. Food : 5/5 Service : 5/5 Ambience : 5/5 Value for money : 4.5/5",positive
"Visited this place for a week. I tried their buffet menus. The ambience is so classy and soothing. The quality of the food were extremely high and good. My personal pick were baked penne, paneer butter masala, dahi papdi chat, chicken with mushroom sauce. My overall experience was incredible here",positive

This was my first visit here. Really Royal in true sense. The food spread is quite large so a person have plenty full of choices. The best part which I liked most is the desert section. I prefer sugar free desert and here they have many options. I just loved the sugar free Rabri. Just one thing that have to be taken care is table attendant must be prompt. You have wait long to get hold of them other then this I just loved this place. Will surely visit again soon.,positive
"I was here for a dinner. The ambiance of the place will make you happy!! Caution: Be very careful about the bookings made in prior. Do take a Booking number because they miss the booking number, which was done some 30 days back. Yet, all thanks to the staff, we got our seat in 10 minutes. And then wow. Let me tell you, it's an infinite spread of food. I was mesmerized by the spread of so much variety for food from different locations of world and India. I really can't mention about any specific spread, but what i can say is, its an absolute must visit place. So pocket friendly and such great service. I loved all the food here. You will take time to visit around the spreads and decide what to start with. Special north East Indian dishes amazed me. I tried everything i would and all of them were amazing. A wow food experience. Would love to visit again.",positive
"‚Ä¢ Sublime decor all around. ‚Ä¢ An extensive buffet spread that includes North Eastern cuisine as well. Almost every food is cooked to perfection. The sushi, veg polenta, cheese bread, pad thai noodles, and all the desserts were my pick.All buffet restaurants have icecream- they have sorbets in addition to icecreams. ‚Ä¢ The staff is extremely courteous. They clean the tables every time after you walk to a counter, allowing you to change plates without any hassle. ‚Ä¢Their is no service charge. All inclusive the cost of weekday dinner buffet is 1495/-.",positive
"As the word 'ROYAL' sits at centre of the name of this hotel, it's restaurant has to be a royal one :) And yeah truly it is so, the outlet was also in my bucket list to visit. Thus for a Bengali what can be the better occasion than Durga Puja itself. Hence visited there for a grand lunch of Nabami, Durga Puja 2019. Literally fell for it's so largely spreaded #Buffet! Though coudn't taste or ate everything but tried whole heartedly to cover maximum of it. Taste was superb with fine decoration of each and every dish. Well behaved and concerned staffs were there to look for minute details of your wants or wishes. Not to mention the hotel itself is a place to visit for and go as usual click-click-click!!!.",positive
What a Grand Grand Dinner. You have so many platters that's it's really impossible for a person to try each and everything. Almost all the dishes are fabulous. Worth every penny and highly recommended. When you get so many platters of every cuisine along with so many unique dishes and in an ambiance which is Royal what else do you want. Indeed Royal Bengal.,positive
"It was a truly awesome gastronomical experience I had at the Grand Market buffet. Considering the price and the spread they have is OTT. Being a foody, my experience was like a kid going to a toy store. Its such a lavish spread and so many options to try...One will be really confused as what one should try and can one leave anything. There were different sections, for Indian, Mughlai, North East, Oriental, Sushi bar, bread and cheese, Veg and Non veg salads, Turkish, Continental, Live Pasta and grill counter, and above all the Dessert section, which had Rabri, Boondi, Phirni, Crepes, 7 varieties of indian sweets, mishti soi, baked sandesh, baked yoghurt, pudding, 7 varieties of cake, 6 varieties of ice cream etc. And all this for 1475 bucks. What more can one ask. So its a must visit and the bonus is the awesome decor and ambience.",positive
"This place makes sure everything about it is far better than others. Be it the entrance, decor, architecture, and most importantly the food, everything was grand. Things I liked were - their enormous spread especially the salad bars, the North east section, the pho section. It is indeed a reasonable price for such fine dining where food, variety, and grandeur is balanced.",positive

"As the word 'ROYAL' sits at centre of the name of this hotel, it's restaurant has to be a royal one :) And yeah truly it is so, the outlet was also in my bucket list to visit. Thus for a Bengali what can be the better occasion than Durga Puja itself. Hence visited there for a grand lunch of Nabami, Durga Puja 2019. Literally fell for it's so largely spreaded #Buffet! Though coudn't taste or ate everything but tried whole heartedly to cover maximum of it. Taste was superb with fine decoration of each and every dish. Well behaved and concerned staffs were there to look for minute details of your wants or wishes. Not to mention the hotel itself is a place to visit for and go as usual click-click-click!!!.",positive
What a Grand Grand Dinner. You have so many platters that's it's really impossible for a person to try each and everything. Almost all the dishes are fabulous. Worth every penny and highly recommended. When you get so many platters of every cuisine along with so many unique dishes and in an ambiance which is Royal what else do you want. Indeed Royal Bengal.,positive
"It was a truly awesome gastronomical experience I had at the Grand Market buffet. Considering the price and the spread they have is OTT. Being a foody, my experience was like a kid going to a toy store. Its such a lavish spread and so many options to try...One will be really confused as what one should try and can one leave anything. There were different sections, for Indian, Mughlai, North East, Oriental, Sushi bar, bread and cheese, Veg and Non veg salads, Turkish, Continental, Live Pasta and grill counter, and above all the Dessert section, which had Rabri, Boondi, Phirni, Crepes, 7 varieties of indian sweets, mishti soi, baked sandesh, baked yoghurt, pudding, 7 varieties of cake, 6 varieties of ice cream etc. And all this for 1475 bucks. What more can one ask. So its a must visit and the bonus is the awesome decor and ambience.",positive
"This place makes sure everything about it is far better than others. Be it the entrance, decor, architecture, and most importantly the food, everything was grand. Things I liked were - their enormous spread especially the salad bars, the North east section, the pho section. It is indeed a reasonable price for such fine dining where food, variety, and grandeur is balanced.",positive
"So today we went there for a buffet lunch.. we went there to celebrate a birthday.. so they gave us a complimentary cake,that was really sweet of them.. The place was very crowdy but you'll definitely like the atmosphere.. Coming to the food menu.. They've many variety in starters.. You'll get fish,prawns,Chicken,mutton as well as veg items.. Then in main course you'll get Chicken fried rice,Chily chicken,mutton railway,katla fish,chicken butter masala and chicken biriyani.. The best part of Barbeque is their various collection of dessert items and the kulfis.. Coming to the quality of the foods.. It was okay,not that good as we expected but not bad as well.. And it costs us 681 including taxes for per person.",positive
"One of the best buffet places in town. It has a huge vareity of items. Food is just awesome. I would suggest to have more of starters and desserts than the main course. As in the menu, it has 6-7 types of starters and let me tell you each one of them is just awesome. Staffs are good. Great place to have lunch and dinner with your family and friends.",positive

"One can get the best buffet here with very high food quality and variety .you will get 3 areas : starter , main course and dessert. You will surely love all of them.The very best of it's kind in the city. I personally did not like one of their desserts and I told them when they asked for my review on their food. After that they humbly requested us to wait for a few minutes and they will get us a new dessert and they actually did that. Such is their service and attitude towards customers..#full satisfaction ‚ô•Ô∏è",positive
"Favourite place . The taste, the food and the service is awfully good with such affordable prices .

There is no need to introduce barbeque nation. This time we visited sector 5 outlet just beside the RDB building. We try non veg buffet. The staffs were friendly and very much polite. Always their staffs communicate with us. Had a wonderful experience...,positive
"One of the most known places for the buffet as well as barbeque lovers.We ordered the dinner buffet which included a no of kebabs as well as other staters which were too excellent, but the main course was below average except the dessert part",negative
"As heard earlier, this place is for those who love to gobble on unlimited food. Not just a luxurious buffet, but also a very courteous service and staff one could ask. The kind of professionalism they exhibit is one of the highlights of my dine-in. This was my first visit with a friend of mine (his 3rd visit). Something was wrong with this Lake mall outlet. Each and every starter they served was marinated with the same mixture. I was there to eat prawns mainly but I was equally disappointed. The prawns were absolutely tasteless. Even my friend, who was his third visit, called and complained to the manager and they couldn't get it right. MAYBE BECAUSE WE WENT THERE ON TUESDAY (629 RS BUFFET) SO THEY SERVED POOR QUALITY PRAWNS. The mutton kebabs were tasteless too. We only loved the biryani and the desert section. Rest everything was absolute rubbish. The crispy corn was the only thing that won our hearts. Rest a big Thumbs down..",negative
"Barbeque nation always have had a good reputation, and it does so. The food here was amazing, we wanted to customise the spicy ness in the starters, and they did that for us . The starters and the main course are the main attraction here. Main course was good but not great.",positive
This place is one of my favorite for having buffet. The options they offer are amazing for the price. The kababs are the main attraction of the buffet. All the preparations in which they make the kebabs are great. The prawn and the mutton seekh kebab is amazing. The fried corn is another stunner out of the lot. After kebabs coming to the desert section. This is another thing in which they Excell. The pan kulfi is amazing. Buffet at barbeque nation is a must try,positive
This is one of my favorite buffet places in Kolkata. I'm a fan of their live grills and desserts. The staff were very polite and attentive.. The food were so good.. I tried almost everything.. my overall experience was great here.,positive
The ambience and service both are nice. The fish kebab is especially nice. The chicken tangri kebab is really good. The mutton dam biriyani is nice but mutton kasha is not up to the mark . The chicken butter masala is standard. The prawn malaikari and ilish bhapa is not upto the mark. The dessert items especially the kulfi is really nice.,negative
"The first thing that you will notice after entering here is the mesmerizing decor and courteous behaviour of the staffs. This is the best place in town for buffet lunch or dinner. In addition to the live grill part, there is a live counter where different types kulfi and biriyani was served. Wide range of veg and non veg starters as well as the desserts section blew our mind. Overall had a lovely experience here..",positive

Place:Oudh 1590üòç The first thing I want to say about this restaurant is it's Ambiance..The Ambiance is awesome and also the background songs are mind-blowing.. We Ordered The most popular Mutton Galawati kabab(Rs/-300) And now I understand why this dish is so popular..The taste is completely different.. We also ordered.. Chicken zafrani kebab (forgot the price) Raan Biryani (Rs/-395) Chicken Irani(Rs/-240) Aam panna Overall a good Experience. Want to visit this place again üòä #thepetukbangali,positive
The best place for Mughlai and Afghani cuisine in town . This place has a great ambience and decor. Also the food served is of excellent quality. The price is a little high for college students but it's reasonable enough for family lunch or dinners.,positive
"Item:- shahi tukda The shahi tukda /tukra is a house favourite dessert dish which has originally originated during the mughal reign and is a very popular mughlai dessert delicacy, the bread is fried in ghee till it turns golden and then it is garnished with kesaria rabri, pistachios, cashewnuts,mawa/khoya kheer. Pocket pinch:-110+ gst Tastology:-8.6/10 . . . Item:- doodh gulab sharbat (pink) & badam sharbat(yellow) Pocket pinch:- (125 & 135 respectively)+ gst Tastology:- 10/10 & 8/10 respectively In one word the doodh gulab sharbat is a must try beverage, it just sets your mood for a romantic date and is a pure bliss while the badam sharbat felt synergetic and rich on flavours with some badam bits to chew on.",positive
"It truly has the taste and atmosphere of mughals and afghanis. Nargisi kofta was just awesome and was blended with full of spices. Never tasted panner rezala like this, they have the finest cook. Briyani is sure shot to eat. You will not find the taste like this anywhere. Last but not the least firni and falooda was awesome. Overall the place has a nice mughali ambience and with nice friendly staff.",positive
Oudh 1590 maybe called the best mughal dining in saltlake! So good gosht biriyani. Had to wait 25 minutes to get a table. Overall good ambience and nice experience,positive
"Okay so starting with starters, chicken tandoori was so succulent and I literally didn't have so tender chicken as this. The awadhi biriyani was enough for 2 people which serves with 2 chicken pieces and two eggs. It has a royal ambience and they play songs in background.",positive
"We went on Friday evening and we had to wait for around 10 mins. But the ambience is quite different and background music adds some flavour to it. Staff were good, while ordering they suggested some good stuffs to have. They told to get lucknowi paratha with galouti kebab. Biryani could have been better. Every item has flavour of rose in it. Overall a good place to dine.",positive
"Visited yesterday. In this Astami. Everyone knows what happens in the restaurant during durga puja time. We had to wait for long. Though its puja time but still food service, experience was good. But for the taste, its better not to visit during puja. üòâ",positive
Perfect place for Biryani lovers. I like the ambience. Raan Biriyani and Galouti kebabs are my favourite. Good place for family and friends to enjoy great food.,positive

"Oudh is my favourite for years. This outlet is the newest at Kalindi, near lake town. We had- ‚Ä¢Masala soda ‚Ä¢ Mutton Galawti kebab ---- recommended ‚Ä¢ Lucknow Paratha ‚Ä¢Mutton Awadi biryani ---- highly recommended ‚Ä¢Chicken irani ----- recommended Dessert: ‚Ä¢Sahi Tukra ----- recommended Their biryani is the best in town. Very light , flavourful made with ghee. Mutton pcs were really soft and juicy. 1 Gandi of biryani is enough for 2 people. You can also try their famous Raan biryani. That was my another favourite. Galawti kebeb needs another special mention , made with smashed mutton and many spices really melts in your mouth. But you must try this kebab with the paratha. I promise that combo is going to amaze you. Service was super quick. The thing i like the most about any Oudh outlet that is their customer service by highly skilled staffs. A highly recommended place.",positive
Went there for dinner amazing ambience loved it staffs are also nice ordered moti mutton biriyani Chicken korma nd tandoori roti ‚ù§ amazing biriyani specially the meat balls resembling moti in the biriyanii ... tasted good will visit again ti have some other biriyani there speciality,positive
Best Biryani to come across without any doubt. The speciality of their Moti Biryani ( basically consists of mutton koftas) being the light yet perfect blend of flavours. They serve a Raita with their Biryani free of charge which is simply amazing. We also had Tandoori Chicken which was equally good. Chicken Irani- very tasty and goes with Biryani as well as Butter Nun. Moreover very appealing ambience.,positive
"This was my first visit to this outlet, and I loved it. We went for dinner on a Sunday, so we had to wait for around 15mins. Then the ambience was amazing like any other Oudh outlet. Food was delicious.",positive
Heaven.. totally heaven for biriyani lovers. Located at Kalindi it is the medium sized biriyani joint for awadhi style biriyani and other mughal dishes... Tried awadhi handi biriyani and chicken kasha.. Must go..,positive
"They menu here is rich in continental items and dishes. Hence you get to try a wide range of steaks, salads and sizzlers here both in meat and seafood. But the Indian dishes are a tad on the weaker side as per my experience.",positive
Well...my childhood friend came all the way from my hometown and he is a huge foodie. So when he told me to meet him for lunch...I knew where I had to take him..even if there was a 45 mins wait..which actually kinda helped us as we grabbed dessert..nolen gurer ice cream..before lunch!! Peter Cat has a different level of standard for sure...food was amazing..and very filling. And the best part was...my friend loved it.,positive
"Went there to celebrate the B-Day of one of my bestie! This place was easy to locate! The dark ambience, royal chairs n the food, blowed all of our minds! We had chicken steak, grilled chicken sizzler, fried chicken, chicken irani kebab, reshmi kebab, Peter cat spl ice-cream, virgin mojito, strawberry shake! Food was super tasty! ü§ëüòç",positive
"This place in park Street always has its own charm. Be it the decor or the hospitality. First and the foremost this place serves real good food just try to look beyond the classic chelo kebabs. Try their bhetki fish meuniere i can bet you will patronize this more than you did for chelo! Also try their indian spread... Its class apart. Be it the tandoori chicken, chicken bharta or the mutton Rogan Josh! Such perfection done to taste and at such an unbelievable price! Last and the most important definitely try their fish fingers... You can't stop at one! We order two plates of it... The tartar sauce is a killer! A very nice experience altogether and remains a kolkata classic as always.",positive

"Iran never fails to amaze the world with its delicacies. And the Iranian Cuisine isn't Iranian at all without the famous Chelo kebab. . . . For chelo, the rice is parboiled, and then fried in a pan, covered with a cloth, and steamed with butter and salt, creating a crispy, golden crust on the bottom. . . . This is served with Iranian Kebabs (the platter has both chicken and mutton kebabs) , butter poached egg and tomatoes and a shiny chunk of butter. . .

This iconic place in kolkata was on my list way before i landed in the city. We were lucky to not get any wait time. The service was decent and the chelo kabab was good. We paired it with some cold buds. Food: 4/5 Ambience: 2/5 (it was too cold!) Service: 4/5,positive
"The legendary outlet, best know for its Iranian-style cheli kababs...a must try. We aldo ordered chicken steak, chicken irani kaba, tandoori kabab, bloody mary and tom collins. The waiters were warm and welcoming and nicely dressed in rajasthani style. We had a great time.",positive
"Pleasant Decor. Delicious Chello Kebab. The butter rice and the sausages were very satisfying to eat. Succulent Chicken Tikkas. Last but not the least Chicken steak Sizzler, served sizzling hot with veggies and brown sauce. Amazing to have . And the chicken portion was filling. However the rice in Chello was low in quantity. Could have gorged more . A worthwhile experience. Pocket pinch on the higher side. Total bill around 1200/-",positive
There is nothing new to add apart from saying Chello kabab is ‚ù§Ô∏è. Cooked to perfection,positive
"They menu here is rich in continental items and dishes. Hence you get to try a wide range of steaks, salads and sizzlers here both in meat and seafood. But the Indian dishes are a tad on the weaker side as per my experience.",positive
Well...my childhood friend came all the way from my hometown and he is a huge foodie. So when he told me to meet him for lunch...I knew where I had to take him..even if there was a 45 mins wait..which actually kinda helped us as we grabbed dessert..nolen gurer ice cream..before lunch!! Peter Cat has a different level of standard for sure...food was amazing..and very filling. And the best part was...my friend loved it.,positive
"Went there to celebrate the B-Day of one of my bestie! This place was easy to locate! The dark ambience, royal chairs n the food, blowed all of our minds! We had chicken steak, grilled chicken sizzler, fried chicken, chicken irani kebab, reshmi kebab, Peter cat spl ice-cream, virgin mojito, strawberry shake! Food was super tasty! ü§ëüòç",positive
"This place in park Street always has its own charm. Be it the decor or the hospitality. First and the foremost this place serves real good food just try to look beyond the classic chelo kebabs. Try their bhetki fish meuniere i can bet you will patronize this more than you did for chelo! Also try their indian spread... Its class apart. Be it the tandoori chicken, chicken bharta or the mutton Rogan Josh! Such perfection done to taste and at such an unbelievable price! Last and the most important definitely try their fish fingers... You can't stop at one! We order two plates of it... The tartar sauce is a killer! A very nice experience altogether and remains a kolkata classic as always.",positive

A perfect dry mutton kosha for the weekend . Chitol maacher moitha was another dish to delish . Must try if you're a fish lover. For Desserts: Need not say more about the desserts .

It is a very nice place for people who wants to try pure bengali cuisine. Mutton kosha was the best dish i liked. I liked it very much. I wanted to know the recipe.

There is place for parking. The ambience is quite nice.,positive

Must try. 3. Doi Ilish: One of the favorite dishes among Bengalis, it had the perfect taste. 4. Kaju Kishmis Pulao: This one could have been better. Not upto my expectations. 5. Kakrar Gal Pethechi: Tried out crab for the first time and it was an amazing experience, thanks to this dish. 6. Chutney of the Day: Got Khejur Aamshotter Chutney and it was a delicacy. Total bill: 3024 bucks. Very prompt delivery. Would love to visit the place some day.",positive

I went their with my family . Our order were - ‚Ä¢ Posto Narkel Bora ‚Ä¢ Murshidabadi Chicken ‚Ä¢ Malai Chingri ‚Ä¢ Basanti Polao ‚Ä¢ Kasha Mangsho ‚Ä¢ Nalengur er Icecream This is the place where you will get the essence of Bengali foods. Most recommended is murshidabadi Chicken ‚ô•Ô∏èüòõ. Actually we ordered something different but due to unavailability of that dish as we went their at Night 10 'o clock and it closes at 10:30 so we have to ordered Murshidabadi Chicken although we love it . It's little bit expensive but the food quality is awesome .,positive
"It is such a fabulous value for money buffet at Rs. 800 that you can drop everything else and tuck into the delicacies. The Beguni is sift and crispy, the chicken chop is mildly spicy. The Chingri malaikari is sweet and thick, the Chicken Kasha is spicy and when had with luchi, it's heavenly. The Parshe Maachh is something that you cannot stop at one. Simply put, the seafood is brilliant. But you cannot miss their Ilish Maachh Bhapa. It's gorgeous and unmissable!",positive
"It was Saptami when I went with my family. I liked the ambience and the taste of the food was really great. I tasted all the items as they were having Durga Puja special menu at that time. I really liked the Chingri Malaikari, Bhetki Paturi, Mutton, Fish Cutlet and Aamey Pora Sharbat. We enjoyed our lunch. Great food with Reasonable price. Highly recommended.",positive
"Absolutely horrendous! Went there expecting the same experience which you associate with the original namesake restaurant, but it was a complete disaster... starting from the starters to the main course.To call the food bland would be an understatement.If the main course and starters were bad ,the dessert section was a whole new low..just pathetic rosogollas , misti doi (not mishti at all) and an abomination in the name of sandesh. I do not know about how the A la carte here is, but the buffet is probably the worst I've ever had, Sunday afternoon ruined .",negative
Visited this place few days ago . It's near cc2 new town. We tried their Lunch Buffet on weekdays and it's cost us Rs 650+ tax . The ambiance was really good. I would say it's one of the best 6 Ballygunge place outlet in terms of decoration .. Coming to the food . 6 Ballygunge never offers Starters in their Buffet Menu which is a down side but apart from that each and every item was delicious. The dessert section could have been better as only Mishti doi and Rossogolla was present .no ice cream no other sweets . My suggestion is if they can include some Starters and atleast ice cream with another type of sweets in the buffet menu then it will be a complete Bengali meal . The staffs were well behaved and always offered service with a smile face .,positive
"Definitely belongs to the premium Restaurants which serves Bengali cuisine . The Ambience is just amazing and gives a feeling of Rajbaris of Kolkata. The staffs are too much good and friendly. They are very well behaved and always at your service . The food is beyond words .The Paturi , Dab Chingri , Luchi Cholar Dal are the Must try. Along with the Danya Chicken and Plain Chicken Curry served with Steamed rice is a perfect lunch. The prices are a bit high but can be considered sometimes. Definitely a must visit place... Thank You...",positive
"Yesterday I celebrated my son's first birthday at lunch time here. We opted for buffet and it's truly a delight. Being a bengali you know the taste of every Bengali cuisine and thus it's all perfect.. I personally liked the kumroni luchi cholar dal and kheer malpoa.. apart from that ,chicken mutton and fish preparations were all superb..the ambience takes you back to Bengali Raj Bari with the decor and background. the staffs are very courteous and friendly.. Overall a good experience and great ambience and perfect to celebrate a special day.",positive
If you want to relish authentic Bengali flavours then 6 Ballygunge is the right place. I have been here quite few times and I love the place for its simplicity and authenticity! Coming on to menu.. there's a wide variety of food that is offered. I never miss to order bhetki whenever I am here. Signature Bengali thali is worth a try. And the desserts will steal your heart. I have to agree I have tasted the best Nolengur icecream here.,positive
"This restaurant near the Westside building , some distance away from city centre 2 . Went for lunch . They have a good buffet spread and ala carte also , accompanied by bar . Very spacious and decorative . Tasted ala carte, mutton , chicken , luchi , nolen gurer ice cream .. all tested are very delicious. Must visit once. Although the lunch buffet looks costly.",positive
Today I went to Shimla biryani after listening so much about it in Zomato and YouTube.The festival is going up to 10th of December. The quality and the taste of the dishes we ordered was too good. We ordered one Kachhi Biryani and Murgh Lahore.The combination of the food is too good.One is spicy and the other is sweet.The amount of biryani they serve is enough for two.The chicken pieces are soo Juicy that I can't forget the taste. It's the first time I tried hyderabadi biryani and my first attempt is memorable. But the staff of this restaurant is not at all experienced. But the ambiance of the restaurant is good for family outing... Loved the biryani very much and every biryani lover should give it a try...I assure u that u will not get disheartened.üòãüòã‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è,positive
"I heard about biryani festival which was going on from 10th November to 10th December. So, we decided to go and taste their new biryani recipe. We ordered chicken reshmi kabab and mutton awadi biryani. Chicken reshmi kabab was horrible. They served biryani in a Eastern pot. The biryani was light and full of dry fruits. The ambiance of the restaurant is really good and their staff's are courteous.",negative
This restaurant is one of the best restaurant for biriyani lover at science City area.. They have started biriyani festival which is going on 10th November to 1oth December .. so we have decided to go to taste some special biriyani .. It is situated near Fortis hospital .. Ambience is too good and classy decor perfect for some family dinner .. We took mutton kachhi biriyani and chicken Lahori .. They served the biriyani in hot earthen pot .. first of all aroma of the biriyani was so good .. quantity of the biriyani for 2 more than enough .. consist of 1 big potato and 1 mutton ..this biriyani was spicy and full of dry fruits .. Chicken Lahori was sweet kind of chicken dish .. perfect combination with kachhi biriyani.. ‚ú®üëç,positive
"Went there today as a biriyani festival is going on.the first floor is really well decorated....among the eleven biriyanis we ordered mutton kima biriyani and mutton awadhi biriyani..... Kima biriyani was good...on the spicy side...very less keema pieces and the piece of the mutton was small....

Today I went to Shimla biryani after listening so much about it in Zomato and YouTube.The festival is going up to 10th of December. The quality and the taste of the dishes we ordered was too good. We ordered one Kachhi Biryani and Murgh Lahore.The combination of the food is too good.One is spicy and the other is sweet.The amount of biryani they serve is enough for two.The chicken pieces are soo Juicy that I can't forget the taste. It's the first time I tried hyderabadi biryani and my first attempt is memorable. But the staff of this restaurant is not at all experienced. But the ambiance of the restaurant is good for family outing... Loved the biryani very much and every biryani lover should give it a try...I assure u that u will not get disheartened.üòãüòã‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è,positive
"I heard about biryani festival which was going on from 10th November to 10th December. So, we decided to go and taste their new biryani recipe. We ordered chicken reshmi kabab and mutton awadi biryani. Chicken reshmi kabab was horrible. They served biryani in a Eastern pot. The biryani was light and full of dry fruits. The ambiance of the restaurant is really good and their staff's are courteous.",negative

"After a long long time, visited this place. The place is located inside Topsia and is the origin of the famous Shimla Biryani. We were in a hurry , so we opted for a quick mutton biryani and a pepsi. Though the biryani rice was good, the mutton piece was average. The biryani was not too dry and not too rich in spicies. I found the biryani to be overall average, not too good and not too bad. But they charged a huge 30 approx for a 300 ml glass pepsi which i felt was highly over priced. Still this is an iconic place famous for its biryani",positive
"This place is very underrated. Idk why but they serves amazing food. I tried blue lagoon, mutton burra kabab, kaachi biryani and chicken chap. They all were heavenly except the chap. The chap had a wierd smell. Apart from that everything was very nice..",positive
"i shouldn't have gone with the brand name . It is located at topsia branch. very ordinary quality and taste. chicken was not cooked at all. i had to throw it after some bite. not worth it according to its price. please be aware while ordering online from this topsia branch. There is another shimla biryani which is located near VIP bazar, ruby area. that biryani was very good. really really good. so if you want to order from shimla biryani then order from that branch which is located at Ruby hospital area.. not from the topsia outlet",negative
"This place is quite close to my house. Ordered Mutton Biryani from here, this was the 2rd time that I ordered. The mutton biryani here is too good, less oily and and the potato and meat is perfectly cooked. I love the taste. Mutton chaap very good",positive
The place was very prompt. It was ruby bus stoppage. Opposite of arsanal restaurant. Staffs were nice. Food is very good. The place is nice. Well decorated. Yes definitely recommend.,positive
This place needs no introduction..one of the best Biriyani destination in kolkata.. Serves some really good lipsmacking delicious biriyani's.. This is another outlet from which i have ordered biriyani recently.. Ordered special mutton biriyani.. The quantity of rice was huge..Two big pieces of mutton.. An egg and a aloo to complement it.. The mutton could have been a bit more soft to make it perfect.. Overall great place to satisfy ur biriyani craving..,positive
"This was my second visit to Shimla Biryani - broken plates and dead insects lying on the table made this visit absolutely pathetic! This place offers a good number of options from North Indian and Chinese cuisine both, their Chinese dishes are tasty whereas the North Indian is just decent! The mocktails are refreshing and the desserts taste quite good too! Most of the items are reasonably priced keeping in mind the quantity and quality. Service is quick but this place surely has a lot of room for improvement!",negative
"This place is on my way to the office. Finally gave it a visit. üòç The ambience is better than expected. Biriyani was really good. But the most beautiful thing was Mutton Burra Kebab. Succulent and very well done mutton ribs tandoor to perfection. Simply loved it. üòã We ordered Tangri kebab, butter nun (4pcs), one plate biryani,kadai paneer,nawabi murgh, firni (2) and it cost us 1224. Not sure if they are costly as the taste justifies the price .üëç Best service in town. Great place to dine out with family. üëç like & follow us üôèüôèüôè",positive
They served very good and tasty biriyani at reasonable price. I ordered 1√óMutton biriyani through zomato which cost Rs.150 but after adding zomato code I have to paid only Rs.100. Now come to the quality and quantity. Mutton biriyani consists one succulent piece of mutton along with one potato and the quantity is enough for one person. Quality of mutton is very good and the mutton is well cooked as like the rice. Quality-5/5 Quantity-5/5 Taste-5/5 Delivery-5/5 And the delivery is on time and the zomato valet is also nice.üòÑ,positive
Well! This place is great to view the rooftop but if I start talking about food. It's not so good. It's just like a normal cafe with expensive menu or nothing else. The ambience is amazing no doubt. All I can say you can go & have some good time over there.,negative
"Amazing ambience,with a nice decor & rooftop option.A cosy place with quite an interesting menu as well.We tried the Spicy Alphonso & Kitkat shake from their beverage menu.Tried pizza as the main course.And for dessert,got the Mini baked alaska-Flambe.All items were pocket friendly & of very good quality.Adding on the rooftop vibe,its must visit place.",positive

"Riyasat @ south city mall has started their 'best of riyasat' lunch menu which consists of 7 course veg and non veg meals consisting of starters, main course and dessert (695/- onwards). We took the non veg meal 1 and 2 since they told us that the meals can't be shared. We started with soup and then there was fish, chicken for starters, tandoori roti, vegetable pulao, daal, corn makki saag, aloo roast, chicken for main course as well and finally dessert. I would like to say that each and every dish was amazing. The daal and the mardana murg for main course were my personal favourites. The service is really upto the mark as the managers and the staff constantly catered to our needs. The only difficulty we faced was with sharing of the set because 14 food items is too much to eat at a go and thus we had to takeaway a lot of food. I personally feel that one set is enough for two people. Other than this, great food, great experience.",positive
"Riyasat is indeed a luxury dining restaurant providing you with an amazing ambience. A special mention definitely goes to their entire team of courteous staff members. Coming to food and service : They have some delicious range of kebabs , Mutton gulouti kebab and bhetki kebab is a must try. We also tried their Dal Makhani which I would strongly recommend. A wide range of cocktails and mocktails were also available and they were quite commendable. BUT coming to their biryani , it was a bit bland and not upto the mark.",positive
"I loved the ambience but not happy with the food. Service were quite slow. Staffs were confused and their coordination with them only were not good. I had to give same order to different staff and when it comes to food ghosht dum biryani was salty and extra spicy. But the kebabs were good. The most annoying thing was when I was giving feedback in their tab, the manager was peeping from behind and I was telling to give decent review. The food is also very costly compared to the taste",negative
"Riyasat, opened in South city mall was a good experience,with good service and good ambience. The veg food though somewhat limited was delicious and we'll presented. The Malai makhani makhana was tasty though I feel it was a misnomer, it was basically a panir dish with just a sprinkling of makhana! But it was delicious. The garlic naan was good. The tomato coriander shorba was presented well and heartwarming. They served an array of dips with lavash at the table...loved it. Lastly the chocolate spoons were a treat.",positive

Riyasat is the best place for the ones who loves north Indian cuisine. Had the opportunity to taste the best dishes of riyasat. All of them were just amazing from starters to main course to desert. This place is a bit expensive but must be tried for at least once. The quality of food is really good and the staff is very polite and courteous.,positive
After a really long time I had a really good biriyani experience üëçüòÄ Yes the riyasat gosht biriyani is a must try here. The starter kababs are too good. Mouth watering taste and big succulent portions of chicken and bhetki served in their chicken malai kebab and bhetki kairi kebab. We had a chocolate vanilla dessert which was equally good. Overall an outstanding food experience. The ambiance is royal and I personally loved the instrumental track that kept playing over and over. Only scope of improvement would be to provide a bit quicker service. On a crowded day the service can get really slow. But the staff are kind and accommodative nevertheless. Would like to visit again to try their set menu.,positive

"This was long due. Have enjoyed the food and atmosphere. Loved the decor and the amazing hospitality. Mutton biryani tasted awesome..it was oil free and had soft, succulent mutton pieces in it. My favourites were Balu Shahi and Choco pudding. You must try them out!!",positive

"This place has the best rooftop ambience in town. Situated on 20th floor of Acropolis, the view from here is breathtaking, as you can see the entire skyline of Kolkata. The food here is pretty decent( i would'nt say the best). We had long island iced tea (it was strong), budweiser, grilled chicken( this was good), spaghetti with meatballs( a bit oily).",positive
"It is beside acropolis mall near kasba. With a breathtaking view on top of the 20th floor, the delectable taste of the food will surely satiate your taste buds and will lift up your mood. I don't remember the name of the dishes though. But it was great fun having the tasty dishes.",positive
One of the best rooftop restuarants in Kolkata. Ozora is located on the 20th floor of Acropolish mall. Ordered chilli pepper lamb and beer battered fish. For desserts ordered blueberry cheesecake. The ambience is lovely there.,positive
Location- This cafe come pub is located at acropolis mall. Food- This place is famous for its cocktails and mocktails..so we have ordered 3 mocktails and one chicken smoke pizza. The taste of the mocktails were too good except one thats the hard on. The taste of the pizza was too good. It has 8pieces and filled with chicken. Ambience- The ambience is too good. But they have one condition. This place has 2 way seating one is the norm and another one is the rooftop..For getting the rooftop u need to pay the cover charge that is 1000 per person.and you have to take food of that amount that extra amount is not refundable but you can make more orders. Price- we got the normal seat inside so the bill was not too much it was just 1200 which is reasonable for this type of place,positive
"One of the best rooftops in Kolkata! They place has a lit ambience,some tasty food & they also serve some good cocktails! I tried a Grilled Chicken with Mashed potatoes & steamed veggies.The chicken was perfect cooked,not to hard & overcooked.The Chicken & Bacon Pizza was good too.The crust was quite thin,the toppings were also in good amount.The contains good chunks of chicken & Bacon.The base was also super cheesy! The drink which I choose was average in taste but I heard alot about their cocktails.The price of the liquors are a bit over priced.You need to pay cover charges if you want to sit on the roof top,which is Rs1000(non-refundable).Will visit this place soon. :)",positive
20th floor and The View üòä Bookmarked this place long back and finally got a chance to visit here. The ambience just jaw dropped meü§ó Food ordered- * Burnt garlic chicken * Mustard Prawn * Barbeque Chicken Wings * Schezwan Fried Rice * Chicken Fried Rice * Hot Garlic Chicken * Basil Chicken All the items we ordered tasted extremely delicious and was really served well The staffs are really courteous A must visit ‚úå‚úå,positive
"Ozora is undoubtedly one of the best rooftop bar cum lounge in the city. It is located on the backside of the acropolis mall on the 20th floor. This is my 2nd visit to this place,and I absolutely loved the view and the ambience were extremely eye pleasing. The staffs were cordial too. We opted for the lounge seats rather than seating outside because it was raining. Also, they will be charging you Rs1000 extra for the rooftop seat apart from the bill. Coming to the food, we ordered bbq chicken wings and assorted mini sandwiches(chicken). There were 6 pieces of chicken, the sauce had a smoky flavour and had a tangy taste. It was good not impressive. The quantity could be bitter as per the price. The sandwiches were served with fries. It was surely very filling. But tasted very ordinary. Our overall bill was 788 inclusive of taxes. Overall, I had a nice experience and that view from the 20th floor is worth every penny.",positive
"One of my wishlisted place. Finally made it there. It was my birthday and I had a great time with my boyfriend. This place I will highly recommend for couples , you'll enjoy the romantic candle light sort of arrangements at the rooftop. A very well decorated, courteous place. The beer availability was less in no. Only three of the particular were available which was disappointing a bit. The food was good not excellent. I won't complain about it as everything overall was very authentic and peaceful. The service was also good, quick. The waiters were very well mannered, decent and polite. They did their best to make us feel comfortable and always came up for reviews which I liked the most. Would definitely recommend it to others! And a special thank you to one of them who clicked a beautiful picture of us ! üíô",positive
"In a single word -""outstanding"" .I think every person should visit this rooftop restrobar at least once in a lifetime. The ambiance speaks for the place itself. Just after sunset the actual aura comes up. The food is also good. We ordered- 1) chicken Ceaser salad 2)chicken mousse ravioli in red wine and mushroom sauce 3)bacon and chicken pizza 4) sheesha and liquars The service is very good. Cost would be 2500 for 2 . A must visit.",positive

"Fish in Mushroom Sauce: The fish was juicy and soft with a perfect blend of the creamy texture of the mushroom. Spaghetti Aglio-oli: Felt a little dry in my opinion but was edible.

Cinnamon Latte: Ordinary coffee, not so special. Didn‚Äôt feel the cinnamon, not so great.",positive
"This place was in my bucket list for long. It has both amazing food and a great ambience. I was completely bowled over by the decorations, the ambience and obviously the food. This place has both indoor and outdoor seating space. The outdoor space with checkered floor and with chairs is a feast for the eyes. The indoor seating area is equally spaced out and beautifully decorated. They have a very elaborate menu which tells you the different types of brews they offer. The staffs are very polite and courteous. We ordered : Peri Peri Chicken Wings : The waitress suggested this since we wanted something spicy. 8 pieces of chicken wings tasted too good.Chicken Lasagna : Absolutely loved this. A wonderful place to spend some quality time with your gang or your special one.",positive
"This place has got both great food and great ambience. The staff is also courteous. I keep visiting this place whenever I have to plan an outing with my friends.

"Just brilliant. This place falls into the category that you recommend to everybody. I found this one on zomato and decided to try it out. And i am glad i did cause it just blew me away. We tried Coffeee browne shake, garlic bread, spinach corn sandwich and onion rings. Everything from presentation, to quality, to taste was just amazing. The amount of brownie they put in the shake was surprising cause most other restaurants just put a small piece on top but in this one you could have it in every sip. The place is crowded and you might have to wait in line on weekends but it will be worth it. Do check this one out. üëåüèªüëçüèª",positive
In a word this place is WOW. Such beautiful decoration. Perfect for capturing some good shots. The outside seating area is more beautiful but We sat inside 'cause it was quite hot out there. It was a sudden visit. I always has fascination for good tea & coffee. So it is a place to be for me. Ordered Pomegranate cold brew for me. It was served in wine glass and tastes beautiful.

Staff service was a bit slow n complacent probably bcoz of puja times. We had ordered Tandoori Chicken- The pieces were tender and juicy but felt it was a tad bit too much oily than we would like. Kashmiri Pulao- This was a bit different from the ortho polao s that we r so accustomed to having but taste was good Chicken reshmi butter masala- no complaints it was as expected. Navaratra mix veg- Again this was different than the usual veg we generally have but none the less it was differently good.

"When we think of pocket friendly restaurants, I am sure you have names in your mind and Tandoor House is one of them. Finally had an opportunity to go out and have a taste of their delicacies. Located at sector-3, which of course means YubaBharati and talking of that derby is round the corner. After having bought the tickets, one definitely wants to have something good. Because you have had one mission successful, the most demanding tickets is in your wallet now. Thought of visiting this outlet hence which took some 20 mins from there. It was indefinitely hot but who cares, love for food is always a priority. Have had their Chicken Maharaja and their Biriyani Combo. Also sharing a glimpse of their combo menu. Do visit soon! No one would want to miss it üòç Amartya Chatterjee",positive
"Yesterday I visited this branch of Tandoor House. The ambiance is good and well decorated. The staffs are good. They r polite. Coming to the main topic, Food. The price of food is very much cheaper rather than other restaurents. But the taste of the food is not so good. It could be better. If your Budget is low, you can visit this place. The food we ordered as follows:- üî¥Fried Rice Combo :- 135/- üîµChele Kabab Combo :- 180/- Thank you",positive
"It's just horrible. Decoration wise the restaurant looks good but their foods are just awful. We have ordered biriyani combo and chicken sizzler. Biriyani was over spiced up and kababs were super dry and butter chicken was also over spiced up. Now comes to the sizzler, it's served with butter rice but it has no butter at all, I have asked the staff 'is that butter rice or normal rice', then he changed the rice and gave me a bowl of 'real butter rice' and the chicken tastes very bad. We just can't have the whole meal.",negative
Location : This place is near the Gariahat Auto Stand. Very easy to find. Ambience : Well lit and cozy place. Ambience is nice. The staffs are very polite and courteous. The quality and quantity of the food the serve is good. We tried two of their combos. Items in both these combos tasted good. This pocket-friendly place is no wonder a paradise for students.,positive

Coming to food we had order ‚Ä¢Chicken briyani combo ‚Ä¢kashrmiri boti kabab So in chicken briyani combo they serve two kabab with chicken chap .So taste of briyani is quite normal the thing which disappointed me us kebab .kabab are dry the quality of Chicken is not good and kababs are over grilled so its tastes very Bad but chicken Chap taste really good.
